Muscle building is all about science.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Anatomy and Physiology\r\n**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.\r\nOnly one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**\r\n\r\nThere are three types of muscle fibers:\r\n- **Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\r\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\r\n\r\nThe size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).\r\n\r\nThe primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.\r\n\r\nThe **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:\r\n- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);\r\n- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);\r\n- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nATP replenishment times:\r\n- 20 sec - 50.00 %;\r\n- 40 sec - 75.00 %;\r\n- 1 min - 87.50 %;\r\n- 80 sec - 93.75 %;\r\n- 100 sec - 96.88 %;\r\n- 2 mins - 98.44 %;\r\n- 140 sec - 99.22 %;\r\n- 160 sec - 99.61 %;\r\n- 3 min - 99.81 %.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)\r\nThere are two types of hypertrophy:\r\n- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;\r\n- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\r\n\r\nSarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).\r\n\r\n**_Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time._**\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called **satellite cells** become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\nHormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:\r\n- **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);**\r\n- **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);**\r\n- **Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);**\r\n- **Growth hormone (GH);**\r\n- **Testosterone.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\r\n\r\n# Efficient, targeted strength training\r\nIf our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let's see:\r\n\r\n|Fiber type|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I|+15|70%|2 - 0 - 1|\r\n|Type IIA|6-12|75-85%|4 - 0 - 3|\r\n|Type IIB|1-3|+90%|3 - 1 - 1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nGeekier:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I sarcomere hypertrophy|15-50|<70%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|>50|<50%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy|6-15|70-85%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|12-25|50-70%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy|3-5|85-95%|3-1-1|\r\n|Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|6-12|70-85%|3-1-1|\r\n|Absolute strength|1-2|>90%|3-1-1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Sets|Reps per set|%1rep-max(1RM)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Maximum muscle size|3|6-12|75-85%|\r\n|Maximum strength|3-7|1-5|>85%|\r\n|Combined muscle and strength|3|3-12|75-90%|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBe careful to **perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.** Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.\r\n\r\n# Best strength training exercises\r\nThe best strength training exercises are unquestionably the **free weight compound movements:**\r\n- **Squats;**\r\n- **Deadlifts;**\r\n- **Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;**\r\n- **Parallel Dips;**\r\n- **Bent Over Rows**\r\n- **Pull-ups / Chin-Ups**\r\n- **Military Presses**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.\r\n\r\nConstantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.\r\n  \r\n# Training frequency\r\nThe muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must **train each muscle group 2-3 times per week**. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.\r\n\r\nFor busy people who don't have much time to spend in the gym, **three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough**. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.\r\n\r\nSmall-boned characteristics:\r\n- Wrist circumferences <10.5% of the height;\r\n- Ankle circumferences <13.0% of the height.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body's systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.\r\n\r\nIdeally, **a rest day should follow each training day.**\r\n\r\nMuscle fatigue is caused by:\r\n- Lactic acid accumulation;\r\n- ATP shortage;\r\n- PC shortage;\r\n- Inorganic phosphate accumulation;\r\n- Peripheral nervous system fatigue;\r\n- Central nervous system fatigue.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe **training session should be for 45-75 minutes**.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\nFor building muscle, we need **minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,** and **10% caloric surplus**. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.\r\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:\r\n- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);\r\n- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;\r\n- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);\r\n- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\r\n\r\n# Other lifestyle factors\r\nOf course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.\r\n\r\nSleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nMake sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.\r\n\r\n**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n- train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;\r\n- focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;\r\n- execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;\r\n- for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;\r\n- for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in >85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;\r\n- for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;\r\n- constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;\r\n- rest ~2 minutes between sets;\r\n- train for 45-75 minutes;\r\n- ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;\r\n- whole good quality food;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;\r\n- scheduled good quality sleep;\r\n- 2-6L water per day;\r\n- relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle1.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle2.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle3.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth1.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth2.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part I: Exercise Selection](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/selection.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/sequence.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/reps.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part IV: Training Frequency](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/frequency.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/split.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/rules.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](https://youtu.be/agUmfvM4rjw);\r\n - [The Truth About Rep Ranges & Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High](https://youtu.be/yLR9rfuE6Sg).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!
