Today, the most famous doctrines developed in religion, health, and fitness. We will focus on the latter two for this article.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at diets, for example. The Keto diet is the one trending now. Just type Keto on YouTube or Google, and you'll be amazed. Keto is a handy tool for weight loss among thousands of people. Does this mean it is right for you?\r\n\r\nAnother example is CrossFit and HIIT. It is handy for shredding fat and building muscle for thousands of people.

We all have different genes, different lifestyles, different environments. Thus, we cannot guarantee that a, for example, a diet is right for us.\r\n\r\nLet me give you another example. Is fish healthy? Damn, right it is. Studies have shown it; humans have been eating wild fish throughout their entire history. Everyone should eat fish, right? Wrong! There are thousands of people with a seafood allergy. Give them fish, and they might even die. Understand my point?\r\n\r\n**Our body has native inner wisdom.** It knows what it's best for it. What we should do is **always listen to our bodies**. There is a caveat, though. We need to understand our body's language. How so?\r\n\r\nWell, just because you crave potato chips doesn't mean you should eat them. They are not healthy. What your body is trying to make you aware of is that you are deficient in, let's say, sodium. Sodium is the primary ingredient in salt, which is the primary ingredient in potato chips. Understand the logic?\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that, although we are all different, we are also common in some way. We are all humans, aren't we? Some fundamentals apply to all of us. Thus, we should never follow dogmas, but rather **understand the basics and customize them to our uniqueness**.\r\n\r\nI've got sick and tired of misconceptions and confusions in health and fitness, so I bought books explaining the fundamentals of human anatomy, physiology, nutrition, and exercise. I have read them from cover to cover and developed a more significant understanding of how the human body functions.\r\n\r\nI invite you to do the same. Instead of letting yourself confused and fooled by dogmas, start reading, learning, and thinking. See the bigger picture in everything.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   we are all unique, and we should understand our uniqueness through our body's signals;\r\n-   we all have a lot in common (we are humans); hence, we should learn the basics and customize them according to our uniqueness (experiment).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n***There you have it!
