You have the money, the time, the motivation to get started. Still, I genuinely believe you need to have some essential points in mind coming from my personal experience of a consistent workout routine (13 years).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't go to the gym as I invested in equipment and work out at home 6 times per week.\r\n\r\nYou can read my article on \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle)\" for more detailed bodybuilding information. Also, \"[The Secrets Of Fat Loss](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-secrets-of-fat-loss)\" offers comprehensive information on how to lose fat, not just weight.\r\n\r\n# Consistency\r\n\r\nIt is not what you do once in a while that counts; it is what you do consistently. If you want to see results from your hard work, you need to be consistent.\r\n\r\n3 times per week is an ideal gym schedule for busy people. If you have more time and enjoy going to the gym, 6 times per week is perfect.\r\n\r\n# Form & Execution\r\n\r\nYou will see huge guys and maybe women lifting very heavy dumbbells and barbells. Don't be discouraged. Everybody started small.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to the gym just for aerobics, start with small intervals. It's ok if you cannot complete the entire workout in the beginning.\r\n\r\nRemember, focus on each repetition or interval and on your breath. Many professional bodybuilders sacrifice good form and cheat their reps just to lift heavy. That is wrong and leads to injury.\r\n\r\nStart small and continuously progress (increase the sets, reps, weights, distance, pace, etc.). to avoid a plateau. You can also switch the exercise routine to prevent acclimatization to the exercise. Check \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle).\"\r\n\r\n# Duration\r\n\r\nYou don't need to spend more than 1 hour in the gym. An intense and heavy workout can be completed in less than 1 hour if you are focused and don't waste time.\r\n\r\nIf you are doing aerobics/cardio and don't have your heart raised to 150 bpm and not sweating, you are not working intensely enough.\r\n\r\nIf you are lifting weights and don't feel the pump or burn, you are not lifting correctly or heavy enough.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\n\r\nExercise is just a tiny part of the equation. Regardless of your goals, you need to have a healthy, balanced diet.\r\n\r\nWant to build muscle? More calories (10%) and protein.\r\nWant to burn fat? Fewer calories (10%) and intermittent fasting.\r\nWant to be healthy? Eat natural, unprocessed food.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to restrict carbs or fat or anything. Just eat real food as natural and minimally processed as possible. This implies a lot of home preparation and cooking.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to drink lots of water. 3L per day is optimal. If you also live in a hot climate or it is summer, 5L is optimal.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nThe body needs to recover. The body is broken down and stressed out in the gym. It is during sleep when the muscle cells are rebuilt and when our healing hormones are secreted.\r\n\r\nA regular sleep schedule is the hardest thing to do in this century. Everybody hates going early to bed. How can we skip going out or watching the latest episode of Money Heist on Netflix?\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want results, you need to sleep from 10:00 pm to 4-5 am at least 5 days per week. Sleep quantity is not that important as sleep quality. 6-7 hours of good quality sleep is perfect. If you have time to sleep more, good for you.\r\n\r\n# Supplements\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, you don't need any supplements. What you need is correct exercise execution and constant progress, a nutritious and balanced diet, and good quality sleep. That's it!\r\n\r\nAfter you've maintained a routine for at least a year, then you can start investing in supplements.\r\n\r\nWhat most fitness addicts recommend is:\r\n\r\n-   whey isolate protein (or pea + hemp protein mix if you're a vegan);\r\n-   l-glutamine;\r\n-   creatine monohydrate;\r\n-   l-carnitine;\r\n-   organic vitamins and minerals complex;\r\n-   krill oil;\r\n-   for lazy days, a pre-workout (citrulline malate, beta-alanine, caffeine).\r\n\r\nAny other supplement is not worth the hype.\r\n\r\n# Patience\r\n\r\nLower your expectations. Don't expect to see significant results in just a month. If you would like to be like Dwayne Johnson, keep in mind that he has been having a healthy and disciplined lifestyle (exercise, diet, sleep) for 10+ years. He is also has a genetically large bone structure.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you would kile to be 6% body fat and have been fat in the past, you need to track your diet plan very strictly.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n***There you have it!
