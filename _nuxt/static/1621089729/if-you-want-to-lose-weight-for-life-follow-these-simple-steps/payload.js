I am a nobody in other words. Why should you listen to me? You shouldn’t, that is the whole point.\r\n\r\nYou should take what I and anyone else writes and says with a grain of salt. Always listen or read, but do your research afterward.\r\n\r\nWhat I am writing is from my own experience and research. I am trying to sell nothing. I struggled with losing body fat in a both simple — but hard — and easy — but complicated and expensive — manner.\r\n\r\nI have been following Greg Doucette, AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, and Vitruvian physique on YouTube, plus reading BodyRecomposition’s [“Fat Loss Fundamentals”](https:\u002F\u002Fbodyrecomposition.com\u002Ffat-loss\u002F4-fat-loss-fundamentals), plus my own experience, and found the same principles.\r\n\r\n\u003E More calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat gain, whereas fewer calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat loss.\r\n\r\nNow, on paper, it is very simple, but we don’t live on paper. We have hormones that dictate our hunger and satiety which may or may not helps us in our fat loss journey.\r\n\r\nSome people are satisfied and stay full for longer periods with less food, whereas others (like me) need a lot of food to be full. It’s genetics and it sucks. I need to eat 3kg of food per day to be full. Imagine that!\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*i-ThPpnYX9QZCDvmC7Q7Ow.jpeg)\r\n\r\n[Meals from Bodily on the day of this writing](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002FHW8fZXHoS8eAFH5ejbwr9OZJsA62\u002Fdiet\u002F2021-04-04)\r\n\r\nThe hunger hormones also change depending on your lifestyle. Poor sleep, alcohol, stress, sugar, low fiber, and protein diet, etc. make us hungrier and less full.\r\n\r\nWe can force ourselves to eat in a calorie deficit for the short term through calorie counting, but in the long term, we will fail. We may also not be able to track always everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, [lifestyle tracking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) is required in the beginning to increase awareness of how much energy you burn through different exercises, how much energy, and how many nutrients different foods have.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to make the process as enjoyable as possible, because it is a life-long process. If you don’t see it this way, you shouldn’t even consider it.\r\n\r\nEnough chit-chat; let’s get to business!\r\n\r\n### The technical\r\n\r\n1.  Know how much you burn at rest (resting metabolic rate);\r\n2.  Know how much you burn through physical movement;\r\n3.  Know how much you eat weekly;\r\n4.  Be in a 10% weekly caloric deficit.\r\n\r\nTo know all of this, you can use [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F). I use it to track my entire lifestyle and it does all the complex calculations for you.\r\n\r\nNow, to make the steps above easier and more natural, let’s see some further steps.\r\n\r\n### The natural\r\n\r\n1.  Eat foods low in calories and high in volume (high protein, fiber, and water content, and low-fat content);\r\n2.  Avoid trigger foods (foods you can’t stop from eating);\r\n3.  Get a good 7–9h sleep every night;\r\n4.  Drink a lot of water;\r\n5.  Eat before drinking alcohol, not after or while drinking;\r\n6.  Move every day.\r\n\r\nThese final steps are something you can do without any phone, just using your common sense. However, you still need in the beginning to track your sleep, movement and eating. After a period of practice, you will eyeball on everything.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.
