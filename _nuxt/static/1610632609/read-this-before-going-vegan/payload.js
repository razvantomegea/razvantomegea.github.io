Now hold your horses for a few moments, and let's think if this is the best idea for you, and I emphasize for you.\r\n\r\n# What Is Your Goal?\r\n\r\nWhy are do you start this diet in the first place?\r\n-   Are you trying to burn fat?\r\n-   Do you want to have more energy and vitality?\r\n-   Do you want to protect the animals and the planet?\r\n-   Do you want to have increased performance?\r\n-   Are you doing it for longevity?\r\n-   Are you doing it for religious purposes?\r\n-   Are you doing it to recover or heal a health condition?\r\n-   Are you doing it because someone else does it or convinced you to do it?\r\n\r\nThe goal is essential because you can achieve any of the reasons above in different ways. However, if your motivation is the latter, we have a problem.\r\n\r\nJust because something works for one or more individuals, doesn't mean it will work for you. We are unique to the biochemical and genetic level. We need to find out what is right for us through experimentation regardless of what others say and do.\r\n\r\nEven if your goal is longevity, vitality, or performance, veganism may not be optimal for you. Fat burning is all a matter of overall caloric and hormonal balance. Veganism may make you store more fat. The only valid goals for veganism are spiritual and environmental protection. Otherwise, try it temporarily and listen to your body.\r\n\r\n# Human Evolution\r\n\r\nMany vegans claim that humans are not meant to eat food from animal sources. We are plant consumers through nature. Are we now?\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at our predecessors, the primates. Are they vegan? Of course not. They indeed eat plants (fruits, leaves, roots) primarily, but also eat insects, birds, and eggs when plants are not available (off-season). Before agriculture, we have been hunter-gatherers for millions of years and fed from plants in season and animals off-season. We are omnivores.\r\n\r\n# Is it for you?\r\n\r\nIgnore when people say that we are meant to be vegans or veganism is better than other diets. You are not the same as other people and are not necessarily intended to be vegan.\r\n\r\nThe only way to know if it is right for you is to give it a shot for a few weeks and see how your body responds. If you feel better as the days go by, then kudos to you. Otherwise, don't force yourself dogmatically. Always listen to your body because it knows what is best for it. Be flexible!\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***There you have it! I hope you enjoyed it and be sure to give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for upcoming quality posts.
