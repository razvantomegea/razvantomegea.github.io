I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[1]={id:"why-walking-is-the-best-exercise",author:a,title:"Why Walking Is The Best Exercise",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2020",categories:c,description:"I am a big fan of walking.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n### Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n### No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n### Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n### Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n### Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.

Alcohol consumption, drug use, smoking, eating fast-food?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat if I told you none of these compare to the habit I am going to reveal in this article. It is a habit I used to have, but I managed to control it. My father and grandfather also have it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis habit is a habit of people who are not at ease with their emotions and lives in general. It manifests differently from one person to another, but it is there. This habit is **excess or abuse**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy father and grandfather are excessively smoking, my mother was drinking in excess, and I was eating and exercising in excess like a bulimic.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther people may be eating sweets in excess when they are stressed; others may be consuming drugs in excess. **It doesn't matter what you are doing as long as it is in excess.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Anything in excess is opposed to nature**, as Hippocrates said. Smoking is not that harmful if done in moderation. Alcohol and fast-food too. Nothing on this planet is unhealthy if the correct portions are respected. Also, any healthy habit becomes unhealthy if abused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**The body can adapt to anything if it is exposed to it gradually**. It is better to try small portions of everything than large ones of some things. For instance, all plants have small amounts of toxins and antinutrients as a part of their survival mechanisms, like oxalates, phytates, lectins, and others. If you consume too much spinach, you may damage your health with too many oxalates.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe tend to overconsume because our primal reptilian brain tells to because we may not know when we'll find food again. It is not a case anymore, but we still do it. If our emotions go overdrive, we overdo or consume. We need to control our emotions and instincts because we are superior to animals in this manner.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if you are doing something in excess? I think we all know deep inside. Our body and common sense tell us, but we are usually in denial. If you can not tell, ask a friend or a close one to give his opinion. The first step is to analyze if you have a habit of consuming something when your emotional. Even excess worrying and stressing are unhealthy as they can make you sick and unhappy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't find any excess in your life, congratulations; you are a balanced person. I still need to work on myself as I tend to overanalyze stuff and focus on the little things that don't matter, but I will become the best version of myself in time, and you with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[3]={id:"is-a-six-pack-worth-it",author:a,title:"Is A Six-Pack Worth It?

It is easy when you're living alone and isolated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI've isolated myself for five years to focus on my career, health, and fitness, and it has cost me dearly. I've lost my social skills, and I can come as anti-social. I am not anti-social, not anymore at least, but I have a little social anxiety. If I think about it, I am causing my discomfort because I don't have my food, and I am not in my habitat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy obsessions with being fit all the time prevent me from having fun and feeling good from time to time on weekends. As hard as I am trying to hide this, people can tell, and it is not cool.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, because of my trauma from childhood when I was overweight, I have come to believe that only if I were to be fit could I be accepted in society. It sucks how some childhood trauma can affect your entire life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to make a balance between social life and my goals through portion control. If we think about it, if I eat correctly five-six days per week, on day of cheating won't do any harm if done correctly. I know that fatty foods are the enemy, so I always eat the slimmest food on the table. When it comes to alcohol, I also choose low-calorie alcohol drinks and avoid soft drinks (I don't like them).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf anything slim or low calorie is available, I consume small, minimal, portions, just enough to not be impolite, because that's what is all about.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go off-road from your plan a day per week, but then you are back on track the following six days, it is perfect. **If the long-term trend is up, it doesn't matter if, from time to time, there are some short-term downtrends**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the end, we are social beings, and **we cannot sacrifice our social life for anything in the world. It doesn't matter if you are rich, famous, fit, and good looking if you are alone and have no one with whom to share your success and happiness.** With patience and dedication, we can balance everything. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[4]={id:"health-and-fitness-myths",author:a,title:"Health And Fitness Myths You’re Probably Believing",createdOn:"Sep 29, 2020",categories:c,description:"The main reason I started this blog is to deliver unbiased, quality information from different aspects of our lives.

I like to **question everything and think outside the box**, and I invite you to take this as an example.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in a student, **teachers taught 20th-century technology and knowledge**. My girlfriend is a medical student, and she approves that medicine professors teach 20th-century medicine as well.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMost professors and PhDs stop researching and reading the latest discoveries in science, so they rely on old studies and knowledge. Not to say that **most of the research studies are biased or read incorrectly.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy point is, **don't take everything for granted**, even from professionals. Question everything, and do your research.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's see some common myths in health and fitness that are wrong.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Cholesterol in eggs is bad\r\n\r\nEggs yolks contain cholesterol, and high blood cholesterol damages the heart. Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCholesterol is **required to help the body synthesize vitamin D and testosterone.** Cholesterol may come from food or can be synthesized by the liver.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because we eat something, high cholesterol doesn't mean we will have high blood cholesterol. There are people with low cholesterol diets that have high triglycerides because they eat a lot of sugar. Also, having **high total blood cholesterol is not bad.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat we call blood cholesterol are lipoproteins of different densities and triglycerides. If you ever did a blood cholesterol test, you probably saw: LDL (and VLDL), HDL, triglycerides, and total lipids. From these numbers, **all that matters is the HDL ratio to the rest of the lipids**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe higher the HDL and the lower the LDL + triglycerides, the healthier you are. Total blood cholesterol is irrelevant. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you with cholesterol tracking and numbering.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen we consume good quality eggs with the yolk, both our HDL and LDL may rise in harmony. Eggs also have amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. They are the perfect food unless you have an allergy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, check Dr. Joseph Mercola's and Chris Kresser's articles ([this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.huffpost.com\u002Fentry\u002Fthe-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKm1it8M9nlsjkhKEVN3T8tq2lwVxTh-4yIpIQftbyHkAKS6MekYGz9KnZOG1qLkH7NW7ozbHbqnXRgnr3pp9z4gUfgNddtLMPnRkixnAfvE0zhkhqel8feSfxoXAuPMTx1NNViz1J757oZCm5br8Qw-mAky4h7VxtMgNSu77JSS&guccounter=2), [this](https:\u002F\u002Fchriskresser.com\u002Fthree-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away\u002F), and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mercola.com\u002Finfographics\u002Fcholesterol-levels.htm)).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Spot reduction\r\n\r\nDo crunches, and you'll lose belly fat. Do squats or lunges, and you'll lose fat from the legs. Unfortunately, we cannot force our bodies to burn fat from where we want. **The place we accumulate body fat is dictated by our genes and by our hormones**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only way to **lose body fat from all the places is through a** [**calorie (energy) deficit**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fdo-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Eating at night makes you fat.\r\n\r\nDon't eat after six o'clock, that's what they say. Wrong!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter when you eat. If your goal is to lose body fat, your only focus should be low calories and high satiety (high protein, fiber, and water). When you eat or how you spread your meals is your choice. If you are always full and in a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat without even trying.\r\n\r\n# Myth: 8 hours of sleep at night\r\n\r\nHow much sleep we need is **dictated by our age, gender, lifestyle, and genetics**. We are not the same, and general recommendations will never work. Some people can are fresh in 6 hours, other in 10.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMore important than sleep quantity is sleep quality. If you sleep 6 hours and are ready to move mountains, you're good to go. **Always listen to your body**, not to medical professionals. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you track your sleep and tell you about your sleep quality.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fast-food makes you fat.\r\n\r\n**No food makes you fat as well as no food makes you lose fat**. If you're eating only from fast-food but are in a calorie deficit, you'll lose fat. Also, if you eat only non-processed, non-GMO, organic, Saint, purified, energized, heavenly food but are in a calorie surplus, you'll gain fat. It is Isaac Newton science.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Alcohol makes you fat\r\n\r\nAlcohol can make you fat if you are eating afterward or while drinking. **Alcohol dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, the satiety and hunger hormones, and causes you to eat more.** If you also drink beer, which has a lot of calories, you'll gain fat for sure if you're in a calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to drink, do not overdo it, choose low-calorie drinks, and eat only before. I drink at a maximum of 1 bottle of dry wine per week, if not per month.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fruit makes you fat because of fructose\r\n\r\nIt is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. How can you say watermelon, which has 30kcal per 100g, makes you fat. I ate this summer 1kg of watermelon per day and lost body fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like how Greg Doucette said: \"I am sure people are overweight and obese because they are eating to much fruit.\" It still makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain and for the last time, **excess calories and only calories make you gain body fat**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   egg yolks are healthy, and you can eat as much as you like, as long as you don't abuse (3-5\u002Fday is ok);\r\n-   genetics and hormones dictate where you store fat;\r\n-   genetics, age, gender, and lifestyle dictate how much sleep you need;\r\n-   alcohol makes you fat indirectly by making you eat more;\r\n-   no food and drink cause weight loss or weight gain directly, only calories.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n***Want more Q&As or myths debunked?

My goal is not to be as big as possible. Muscles grow very slow if you have been training for a long time and don't have rare genetics. Thus, I choose to look fit like an athlete at the expense of not looking so big.\r\n\r\n# Strength training 3x per week\r\n\r\nI do a full-body strength training three times per week. You may think this is for beginners, but it is not. The legendary bodybuilder Reg Park and Steve Reeves (and other old-school bodybuilders) were fans of this style of training. They were big, lean, and natural.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI did for a while upper-lower slipt and push-pull-legs split, but this is the one I enjoy doing the most. **When I do multiple exercises per muscle group in a single session, I feel I can't push at the maximum at each muscle group exercise.** It makes sense if you train as hard as you can at the first exercise, you then exhaust the muscle and won't give it your all at the following.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy legs are the biggest victims. After I do heavy squats or Bulgarian split squats, I can't walk; my legs are shaking. I would be exhausted if I were to do 2-3 leg exercises in one session.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI think if you train correctly and intensely, you need less time in the gym. The muscle needs stimulus to grow, not destruction. Your **muscles don't grow in the gym, but during recovery**, if you provide them all nutrients.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnother important point I want to make is I focus on **compound movements, using only bodyweight, free weight, and pulley** based exercises. I feel they engage me the most and have a functional implication on the body.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at my workouts, shall we?\r\n\r\n## Workout #1 Monday:\r\n\r\n-   Bench press;\r\n-   Weighed pull-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Arnold press;\r\n-   Lying triceps extensions;\r\n-   E-Z Bar barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #2 Wednesday:\r\n\r\n-   Incline dumbbell press;\r\n-   Barbell rows;\r\n-   Military press;\r\n-   Rope triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Dumbbell curls;\r\n-   Bulgarian split squats;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #3 Friday:\r\n\r\n-   Weighed dips;\r\n-   Weighed chin-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Lateral raises + rear delts superset;\r\n-   Triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the big muscle group exercises, I do **one warm-up set of 10-15 reps, and four working sets of 3-6 reps with the same weight**. When I can do six reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the small muscle group exercises, I do **four working sets of 5-8 reps**. When I can do eight reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne important note: I have **2-minute breaks between sets**, I **don't cheat**, and I **focus**  **on slow eccentric (negative)**. I do a 1-2 second concentric, 1-second isometric, and 3-4 second eccentric. The negative movement of the exercise has a higher impact on muscle growth than the positive one (check out [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.marksdailyapple.com\u002Fwhy-you-should-lift-and-lower-heavy-things\u002F)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, my workout routine allows me to recover between sessions. **When doing a high-intensity workout, your muscles are not the only ones exhausted, but your nervous system as well**. The nervous system doesn't have time to recover if one is doing a heavy high-intensity workout on consecutive days.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't do direct exercise on calves, forearms, and traps because they are worked indirectly by the compound movements.\r\n\r\n# Walking\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the days, I like to take long walks. Walking has no demand on the nervous system and even **helps with recovery**; not to mention that it **burns a lot of calories**. If you walk 12km, which is about 15.000 steps, you burn 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about walking is that you can do it anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I do full-body workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday;\r\n-   I do only compound movements;\r\n-   I do five sets for the big muscle group exercises, and four sets for the small ones;\r\n-   I focus on slow negatives (3-4 seconds) and correct form;\r\n-   I take 2-minute breaks between sets;\r\n-   I take long walks (12-15km) in the days off.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1610632609",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:d,links:[{url:e,icon:"mdi-heart",title:f},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:"HEALTH","mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:{},articles:g,searchQuery:b,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:g,isSearching:d}},serverRendered:true,routePath:e,config:{}}}("Razvan Tomegea","","Health, Fitness",false,"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth","Health",Array(6)));
