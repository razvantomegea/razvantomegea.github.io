If you don’t know or believe this, you are lying to yourself.\r\n\r\nAny sustainable way to achieve this is good for losing fat for life. In this article, we will talk about the best exercise for losing fat. It is not only the best exercise, but maybe the best, easy, and simple way to lose fat.\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is? It is not what you expect. It doesn’t involve any complex or heavy movement. It is “put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down.”\r\n\r\n### Put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down\r\n\r\nThe exercise of stopping from eating is the best exercise for losing fat. The premise is simple: you can’t ever out-exercise a chaotic diet.\r\n\r\nThe average exercise session burns 500kcal per day. The average resting metabolic rate is 1500kcal per day. Let’s assume we have 300kcal per day of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and thermic effect from food.\r\n\r\nWe have a 2300kcal average energy burn per day, and it is not much. 2300kcal is a large pizza and one soda. Who can live in one day with only that food? I wouldn’t and couldn’t.\r\n\r\nSo we see that only 30% (at maximum) of our daily energy consumption is from physical exercise. The rest is from our metabolism and day to day movement.\r\n\r\nThe only simple and efficient way to lose body fat is through diet control, which is what putting the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks (or hand if you eat like a pig like me) down.\r\n\r\nYou can lose fat without moving a finger, only by tracking your meals. Exercise is not for fat loss. Exercise is for body recomposition, health, and longevity.\r\n\r\nI track my meals with [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), the health and fitness app developed by me. It is still a work in progress, but hopefully, I will launch it this year.\r\n\r\n\u003E The takeaway is this, you will never lose weight if you have no idea how many calories you are eating and burning. The moment I stopped tracking my daily energy intake and consumption it the moment I started gaining body fat.\r\n\r\nThe people who are fit and don’t know what they are eating have a higher than average metabolism or are getting full fast and with small meals (like my girlfriend). They are in a caloric deficit or maintenance in the background.\r\n\r\nI need to eat 1kg of food in one sitting to get full. I eat around 2kg of food daily to not feel hungry. I lose fat because I eat foods high in volume and low in calories, like vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products. I am fit because I track almost everything 5 out of 7 days.\r\n\r\nShould you listen to me? Of course not. I am not a health and fitness professional. I am just sharing my own experience and the lessons learned from [The Science of Nutrition](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FScience-Nutrition-2nd-Janice-Thompson\u002Fdp\u002F032164316X), Athlean-X (Jeff Cavaliere), Greg Doucette, Jeff Nippard, and Kinobody (Greg O’Gallagher). It’s your choice what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends. You can leave a comment on what you would like for me to write in the future. Also, how can I improve? I would appreciate it very much."},{id:"safest-stock-investment",author:a,title:"The Lowest Risk, Time Proof Investment Everyone Should Choose",createdOn:"9 Jan, 2021",categories:"Finance",description:"Average 10% annual return",imageCredit:"Photo by William Iven on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FdAmHWsRYP9c",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\safest-stock-investment.md"},markdown:"Hey there. Welcome to the blog. I hope you are doing well. In this article, you will discover the lowest risk asset in the stock market, which has always returned profit throughout the decades.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is for educational purposes only. I am not recommending you to buy any assets. You choose what you do with your money. I am not a broker or a financial expert. I am just sharing an investment asset that has returned profits for more than a century.\r\n\r\nThis investment is also Warren Buffet’s (the best investor) [best recommendation for non-professionals](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=-GrKhUdu-YE). I don’t know about you, but I am listening when he suggests an investment.\r\n\r\n### S&P 500\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is the safest and simplest investment in the stock market. No investing knowledge and time consumption required. According to [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fsp500.asp), the S&P 500 is an index representing the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOver the decades, no or few investing portfolios outperformed this index. We also need to keep in mind that there is no need to research anything.\r\n\r\n\u003Ciframe title=\"S&amp;amp;P 500\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fDZ7A\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdatawrapper.dwcdn.net\u002FfDZ7A\u002F1\u002F\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"400\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003Cscript type=\"text\u002Fjavascript\"\u003E!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\r\n\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the chart above, you can see that the S&P has been bullish for 90 years. Of course, we have some temporary crashes during recessions, like those in 2001 and 2008, but it bounced back afterward.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 will always be there because it is updated regularly. If a company doesn’t perform, it is replaced by a better one. There will always be the top 500 companies in the U.S. Makes sense?\r\n\r\nI am investing in this index, and I wanted to share this information with you. Now, you choose what you do with this information.\r\n\r\nDon’t ever take my or other peoples’ articles for granted. Always research the information and ask questions to avoid being misinformed.\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"},{id:"I-made-peace-with-my-parents",author:a,title:"I Made Peace With My Parents",createdOn:"Dec 15, 2020",categories:c,description:"I had a conversation with my father yesterday, and we got to a subject we should have had long ago.",imageCredit:"Photo by Wesley Tingey on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002F58CC8avpLgA",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\I-made-peace-with-my-parents.md"},markdown:"I had a conversation with my father yesterday, and we got to a subject we should have had long ago. I told him I never felt a loved and desired child and that he never did anything for me. It stroke him through the heart. He couldn’t believe what I just said.\r\n\r\nA little background, my parents divorced when I was 10, and my father raised me on his own. After a few years, he married another woman, and they formed a new family. I felt pushed away ever since.\r\n\r\nMy father was always cold and difficult to deal with. He never told me he loved me or hugged me or anything. My mother had drinking problems, and they both were more focused on their issues than on me.\r\n\r\nI associated this without being loved, but now that I heard my father’s story, and now that I write my thoughts, I realize how childish and egotistical of me.\r\n\r\nMy father was always beaten by his father, and his parents also never showed him they loved him. He also went into the army at 14 years old and made his own life from scratch. Life made him cold and unable to express his feelings as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was raised by an abusive father and in a family with issues and violence. She was weak, and because my father is how he is, she felt unloved by both her husband and her father.\r\n\r\nI judged my parents for so many years and blamed them for me being so sensitive and unconfident. It turned out it is not their fault. They had the same and even worse childhood like I did.\r\n\r\nThere are so many children raised in a hell of a family, and they turn out tougher and less frustrated than me.\r\n\r\nYou see, I learned a lesson from which you can benefit as well:\r\n\r\n\u003E Never judge a person before you put yourself into her shoes. You are most probably no better than she is.\r\n\r\nI realized my parents did what they could to make me the person I am today. I have no right to judge them. I need to take full responsibility for my life, stop the victim mentality, and live my life at full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is my fault from now on that my life is how it is. My past is past, and it is what it is. We cannot change our parents and family. We receive them for a reason, and we need to accept them as they are. We don’t know the big picture yet.\r\n\r\nIf this relates to you, maybe it's time you made peace with your parents and your past too. Or maybe you are a parent and have never shown (unknowingly) your kid the love he expected.\r\n\r\n\u003E The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now. — Chinese proverb\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"},{id:"how-I-stay-motivated",author:a,title:"How I Stay Motivated",createdOn:"Nov 28, 2020",categories:c,description:"Every person should have goals in life if he wants to have a meaningful life.

I life without meaning (or direction) is an empty life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, goals are not enough; **you must achieve your goals; otherwise, they are just fantasies** - dreams. The only way to achieve goals is by doing the work.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs simple as it sounds, **it is not easy at all**. The only thing that stays in our way to achieving anything in life is our ability to **decide to do work**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe biggest question is **how to decide** to do the work? In other words, **how to get motivated** to get to work? You might not like the answer: you don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**_Motivation is just a temporary and limited energy burst (feeling) that helps you to do the work._**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI cannot stress temporary and limited enough. Here's the thing, \"I achieved everything because I was motivated every day of my life,\" said no successful person ever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**No one is motivated every single day of their life**. Every person would rather stay in bed and scroll Instagram or Facebook 24\u002F7. It is so comfortable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSuccessful people **decide** to do the work and **accept** it is the right thing to do. In the beginning, it is very hard, but in the long term, it becomes **automatic - a routine**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is the secret to progress in any area. **Create routines** so that you no longer need to think to do something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, eating healthily, exercising, cooking, working on my projects, waking without an alarm clock have become automatic. I've been doing them for so long, they have become something natural and fun to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you may ask: how to be motivated in the beginning, before creating a routine?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI will reveal two secrets:\r\n\r\n1.  **_Motivation is a tank that is full in the morning and empty in the evening;_**\r\n2.  **_Focus on long-term fulfillment and happiness than on short-term pleasures._**\r\n\r\nThese are the two secrets that helped me achieve anything.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always do the most important and most challenging things first thing in the morning because I am most motivated then.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always think of: \"How proud would I be of myself in the future if I looked back and saw myself choosing work instead of procrastination?\". I also hate the guilt and frustration after not doing what I need to do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI can reframe everything in a single sentence: **do the difficult and disgusting things now; relax and enjoy later.** It is my main principle and philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"}]}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:"LIFESTYLE MANIACS"}]]}}("Razvan Tomegea","","Self-development")));
