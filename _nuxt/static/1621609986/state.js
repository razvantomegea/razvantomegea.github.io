He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down. He sold part of Bitcoin and no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment method for no logical reason.\r\n\r\n\u003E Before we continue, I invite you to blow up the Upvote and Recommend buttons to help more people read this article.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet, Elon Musk said that Bitcoin uses electric energy for mining coming from fossil fuels, which doesn’t match with Tesla’s green energy philosophy. Come on!\r\n\r\nElon Musk is the man who created Paypal, sends rockets to Mars, and triggers the E.V. boom. He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though. A genius like him must have a plan. Or he may just like having fun with his influence.\r\n\r\n\u003E With great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the lessons from this experience are:\r\n\r\n-   listen to influencers with a grain of salt;\r\n-   crypto is prone to (psychological) manipulation, which makes it far from adoptable.\r\n\r\n# Bear market already?\r\n\r\nIf we go below the 200-day EMA, most probably.

Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

You probably learned the basics; if not, I encourage you to watch some [YouTube videos](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fresults?search_query=coin+bureau+technical+analysis), take some [courses](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade), or read a [book](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCharting-Technical-Analysis-Fred-McAllen-ebook\u002Fdp\u002FB007PRECN2\u002Fref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1620459299&sr=8-1) on this topic. I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.

Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives.

Always listen or read, but do your research afterward.\r\n\r\nWhat I am writing is from my own experience and research. I am trying to sell nothing. I struggled with losing body fat in a both simple — but hard — and easy — but complicated and expensive — manner.\r\n\r\nI have been following Greg Doucette, AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, and Vitruvian physique on YouTube, plus reading BodyRecomposition’s [“Fat Loss Fundamentals”](https:\u002F\u002Fbodyrecomposition.com\u002Ffat-loss\u002F4-fat-loss-fundamentals), plus my own experience, and found the same principles.\r\n\r\n\u003E More calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat gain, whereas fewer calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat loss.\r\n\r\nNow, on paper, it is very simple, but we don’t live on paper. We have hormones that dictate our hunger and satiety which may or may not helps us in our fat loss journey.\r\n\r\nSome people are satisfied and stay full for longer periods with less food, whereas others (like me) need a lot of food to be full. It’s genetics and it sucks. I need to eat 3kg of food per day to be full. Imagine that!\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*i-ThPpnYX9QZCDvmC7Q7Ow.jpeg)\r\n\r\n[Meals from Bodily on the day of this writing](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002FHW8fZXHoS8eAFH5ejbwr9OZJsA62\u002Fdiet\u002F2021-04-04)\r\n\r\nThe hunger hormones also change depending on your lifestyle. Poor sleep, alcohol, stress, sugar, low fiber, and protein diet, etc. make us hungrier and less full.\r\n\r\nWe can force ourselves to eat in a calorie deficit for the short term through calorie counting, but in the long term, we will fail. We may also not be able to track always everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, [lifestyle tracking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) is required in the beginning to increase awareness of how much energy you burn through different exercises, how much energy, and how many nutrients different foods have.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to make the process as enjoyable as possible, because it is a life-long process. If you don’t see it this way, you shouldn’t even consider it.\r\n\r\nEnough chit-chat; let’s get to business!\r\n\r\n### The technical\r\n\r\n1.  Know how much you burn at rest (resting metabolic rate);\r\n2.  Know how much you burn through physical movement;\r\n3.  Know how much you eat weekly;\r\n4.  Be in a 10% weekly caloric deficit.\r\n\r\nTo know all of this, you can use [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F).

Eat foods low in calories and high in volume (high protein, fiber, and water content, and low-fat content);\r\n2.  Avoid trigger foods (foods you can’t stop from eating);\r\n3.  Get a good 7–9h sleep every night;\r\n4.  Drink a lot of water;\r\n5.  Eat before drinking alcohol, not after or while drinking;\r\n6.  Move every day.\r\n\r\nThese final steps are something you can do without any phone, just using your common sense. However, you still need in the beginning to track your sleep, movement and eating. After a period of practice, you will eyeball on everything.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.
