Heck, even I am still struggling with confidence from time to time. However, I found some tricks that work for me during dark times.\n\nHere’s the deal; our inner state fluctuates. We cannot be constantly happy and smiling. There are times when we are sad, angry, depressed, and it’s ok. We need to accept and understand this is temporary.\n\nWhen it comes to confidence, it is something built during childhood. If your parents and family were supportive, then you probably have confidence.\n\nIf your family was not there for you when you needed them the most, or you have some childhood traumas, as I do, then you probably have some struggles with confidence.\n\nNo worries, though. You are not doomed. You can start building your confidence if you accept you have some issues with this part. We all have issues in some areas because we are imperfect humans in constant need of improvement.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that every person has different focus points that make her confident.\n\nFor instance, some people are confident if they have money or a good-looking car, whereas others are confident if they have good-looking bodies or clothes.\n\nThe truth is, all of these external helpers for confidence are something that the inner child always craved.\n\nIn my case, self-confidence comes from being fit, wealthy, and having loving people around me. It is because I lacked these things during my childhood.\n\nHowever, self-confidence should be independent of external factors and only dependent on faith and love from within.\n\nThus, let’s see what you can do to increase your self-confidence.\n\n# 1. Take care of your body\n\nEvery person who eats, exercises, and sleeps well is feeling great. There is also an old saying: “Mens sana in corpore sano,” which translates to “A healthy mind in a healthy body.”\n\nYour mind cannot be well if your body is not well. If your mind is not well, your life cannot be well. Everything begins from the mind.\n\nThe first step to increase your self-confidence is to take care of your body. Eat healthy food, exercise regularly, set a sleep schedule, and become healthy and fit.\n\n# 2. Set and complete realistic goals\n\nIn other words, get things done. If you are procrastinating and doing nothing, your subconscious will think of you as a loser. There is nothing worse when you sabotage yourself.\n\nI also found that a life without goals is meaningless. Learn something new, develop some hobbies, start some projects. You will increase your self-confidence for sure because you know within you are successful.\n\n# 3. Improve your posture\n\nIt is silly, but it works. It makes sense if you think about it. When you stay straight, you send signals to your brain that you are open and ready to face the world. More about this  [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2009\u002F10\u002F091005111627.htm).\n\nWhen you are sad, depressed, or scared, your body’s response is to slouch and be small. It turns out that vice versa is also true. When you slouch and get small, you tend to be depressed and sad.\n\nOur body and mind are linked bidirectionally. It is the same when you force yourself to smile when you are sad. You cannot smile and be sad at the same time.\n\n# 4. Meditate\n\nThere is a lot of research on meditation and its benefits. Meditation’s primary purpose is to train your mind and be present. You are also facing your thoughts, emotions, and inner world.\n\nThrough meditation, you will develop the discipline to control yourself and to no longer be in reaction. You will become more confident, calmer, and happier. You will also be able to sleep better and focus better.\n\n# 5. Love and accept yourself\n\nJesus said: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” It means you should love yourself first. If you don’t love yourself, how dare you expect others to love you?\n\nYou are the one who spends the most time with yourself, so you better learn to know, accept, and love who you are. There is and always will be one of you in this life.\n\nDon’t be too rough on yourself and accept you made and will make mistakes. We all do.\n\nWhen you begin to love yourself, you will love the world, and what others say and do won’t affect you anymore. You will have faith and confidence in yourself."};f[1]={id:"my-10-simple-tips-for-a-healthy-and-fit-lifestyle",author:b,title:"My 10 Simple Tips For A Healthy And Fit Lifestyle.",createdOn:"Jul 02, 2021",categories:"Health, Fitness, Self-development",description:"The Best Of Both Worlds.",imageCredit:"Photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FRLw-UC03Gwc",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fmy-10-simple-tips-for-a-healthy-and-fit-lifestyle.md"},markdown:"Being healthy and fit is very difficult because we think the two are synonyms. However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n# Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n# Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fyou-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n# Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n# A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n# Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n# Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fmy-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n# A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n# Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n# Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n# Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional. Everything I write on the topic is for informational and educational purposes only.

I told him I never felt a loved and desired child and that he never did anything for me. It stroke him through the heart. He couldn’t believe what I just said.\r\n\r\nA little background, my parents divorced when I was 10, and my father raised me on his own. After a few years, he married another woman, and they formed a new family. I felt pushed away ever since.\r\n\r\nMy father was always cold and difficult to deal with. He never told me he loved me or hugged me or anything. My mother had drinking problems, and they both were more focused on their issues than on me.\r\n\r\nI associated this without being loved, but now that I heard my father’s story, and now that I write my thoughts, I realize how childish and egotistical of me.\r\n\r\nMy father was always beaten by his father, and his parents also never showed him they loved him. He also went into the army at 14 years old and made his own life from scratch. Life made him cold and unable to express his feelings as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was raised by an abusive father and in a family with issues and violence. She was weak, and because my father is how he is, she felt unloved by both her husband and her father.\r\n\r\nI judged my parents for so many years and blamed them for me being so sensitive and unconfident. It turned out it is not their fault. They had the same and even worse childhood like I did.\r\n\r\nThere are so many children raised in a hell of a family, and they turn out tougher and less frustrated than me.\r\n\r\nYou see, I learned a lesson from which you can benefit as well:\r\n\r\n\u003E Never judge a person before you put yourself into her shoes. You are most probably no better than she is.\r\n\r\nI realized my parents did what they could to make me the person I am today. I have no right to judge them. I need to take full responsibility for my life, stop the victim mentality, and live my life at full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is my fault from now on that my life is how it is. My past is past, and it is what it is. We cannot change our parents and family. We receive them for a reason, and we need to accept them as they are. We don’t know the big picture yet.\r\n\r\nIf this relates to you, maybe it's time you made peace with your parents and your past too. Or maybe you are a parent and have never shown (unknowingly) your kid the love he expected.\r\n\r\n\u003E The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago.

The only way to achieve goals is by doing the work.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs simple as it sounds, **it is not easy at all**. The only thing that stays in our way to achieving anything in life is our ability to **decide to do work**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe biggest question is **how to decide** to do the work?

I also hate the guilt and frustration after not doing what I need to do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI can reframe everything in a single sentence: **do the difficult and disgusting things now; relax and enjoy later.** It is my main principle and philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[5]={id:"the-most-important-question-you-should-ask-yourself",author:b,title:"The Most Important Question You Should Ask Yourself",createdOn:"Oct 28, 2020",categories:a,description:"The answer is the hardest yet fulfilling.",imageCredit:"Photo by Avery Evans on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FNOm4f0xx2bU",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fthe-most-important-question-you-should-ask-yourself.md"},markdown:"I like to ask a lot of questions because there is a lot of crap fed to us out there. Our times require this attitude to life to prevent us from being fooled.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write something on a rock before I die, it would be:  _“question everything.”_\r\n\r\nEvery few thousand years, Gods (or God) we believe in are scientifically proven to be unmythical, and then we create another God. This fact is enough for you to take into consideration my opinion about questioning.\r\n\r\nThere is a question, however, with which I am still struggling to answer. Its difficulty lies in its relativity and bias. I believe a few people on this planet can answer it, which is one of the root causes of global chaos.\r\n\r\n\u003E Who am I?\r\n\r\nAnother formulation of this is “Know thyself,” which is one of the  [Delphic maxims.](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDelphic_maxims)\r\n\r\nSince the era of Greek philosophers, like Socrates, the problem of knowing oneself has been a priority in a man’s development and connection with the divine.\r\n\r\nI believe that we have lost our connection with ourselves, and it is a must to re-establish that connection if one’s happiness and success are goals in life.\r\n\r\nWe listen and believe what the news, social media feed, friends, family, medical doctors, and influencers say is good for us, but is it now?\r\n\r\n\u003E Knowing yourself helps you discover your purpose in life. It is independent of age, gender, race, lifestyle, and any demographic. It is the most profound connection a person could ever feel.\r\n\r\nThis connection may take a lifetime to establish, if not more. Not knowing yourself means living an empty (soulless) life without a sense of direction of what is good or bad. I know because I felt it.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little boy, I had the desire to create something that would help other people and myself. I wanted to be a hero in a way or another. Maybe I watched too many cartoons, but anyway, that desire exists even now.\r\n\r\nFor a period, I lost my connection with myself, and I had like an existential crisis, but now I am coming back on track. We all have ups and downs in life, and it is important to always get on our path.\r\n\r\nWhat should you do to get closer to knowing who you are?\r\n\r\n# Listen To Yourself\r\n\r\nDevelop the habit of listening to yourself. Analyze your thoughts and emotions in different scenarios. Understand why you are reacting like you are. Experiment with yourself. Ask questions to yourself.\r\n\r\n# Spend Time Alone\r\n\r\nIf you always surround yourself with people and external distractions, you will never focus on the inside.\r\n\r\nTry to disconnect and free your mind. Let your mind wander and re-arrange your thoughts. It can be an opportunity to meditate by being present and listening to your inner voice.\r\n\r\nDuring these difficult times, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and knowing oneself.\r\n\r\nI am not saying you should isolate yourself from people completely but only a few hours per week.\r\n\r\n# Journaling\r\n\r\nJournaling is a self-therapy through which you put your thoughts and emotions on paper. It can be a way to understand yourself better. If you do not like writing, you can record yourself. It is necessary to be consistent.\r\n\r\nI found that the best way to understand myself is by taking long walks alone. It is my time for me to relax and self-reflect. I think better when I move my body.\r\n\r\nFind whatever helps you relax and free your mind and do it as often as possible. It will change you from inside out.\r\n\r\n# Decide Who You Want To Be\r\n\r\nIn the end, we all have a choice on who we want to be. We can visualize a version of ourselves that would trigger goosebumps on our skin. We can choose to be our own superheroes and live a life worth writing about.\r\n\r\nI chose years ago that I want to contribute to the world in a way or another to make it better. I found the best way to do this is through the power of example.\r\n\r\nIf you want to master the world, master yourself. If you want to master yourself, master your thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nWhat about you? Do you know who you are or who you want to be? Leave a comment with your vision about yourself.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends. You can leave a comment on what you would like for me to write in the future. Also, how can I improve? I would appreciate it very much."};return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1636982132",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:d,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:e,icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:a},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:"SELF-DEVELOPMENT","mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:{},articles:f,searchQuery:c,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:f,isSearching:d}},serverRendered:true,routePath:e,config:{}}}("Self-development","Razvan Tomegea","",false,"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",Array(6)));
