This app is the merge of my two passions and skills.\n\n**Why make something that already exists?** The truth is, it doesn’t. You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up. What if you change your phone operating system? What if you want to use the apps on your PC? Think about the hustle.\n\n# Bodily app\n\n[The Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) is an all-in-one lifestyle tracker and you can find it online. What makes Bodily unique is that it has **all the health and fitness trackers** in one app.\n\nYou also don’t need to download anything, so you can use it in your browser from any device and it is quite fast.\n\nIn the future, Bodily will be a **health and fitness social media**, similar to Strava, but with more features.\n\nThink about it, **what if you had a health and fitness profile online where your friends and your doctor can easily see your lifestyle**? Some kind of health and fitness page, which can also be private. That’s the goal of Bodily.\n\nFor now, I managed to implement only regular manual tracking, with minimal automation to speed up the process. For me, it takes an average of **2 minutes per day to track everything**. Is it a lot? Leave a comment.\n\nCurrently, you can track your **body composition, diet plan, exercise plan, sleep schedule, water intake, blood lipids, and blood glucose.** More biomarker trackers will come.\n\nYou can also **create workouts using existing workout exercises** classified by muscle groups, equipment, exercise type, and more.\nYou can use the app to **search for thousands of recipes**, using filters like diet, calorie content, cuisine, macronutrient content, and more.\n\nThe app has a [YouTube channel,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCkho_iFnebE-km74uhG3Egw) [Facebook page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fbodilyapp), and [Instagram page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), on which you can currently find tutorials for tracking your water intake, and diet plan. More tutorials and posts will come.\n\n# Pricing\n\nOf course, the **app is not free**. You have a 30-day trial, and then it will be 2 EUR\u002Fmonth. It is not expensive, nor cheap. It is the regular price of memberships out there.\n\n";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1630746107",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:b,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:a,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:b}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthis-new-all-in-one-lifestyle-tracker-will-supercharge-your-health-and-fitness-goals",config:{}}}("",false,"This New All-In-One Lifestyle Tracker Will Supercharge Your Health And Fitness Goals",{},Array(1)));
