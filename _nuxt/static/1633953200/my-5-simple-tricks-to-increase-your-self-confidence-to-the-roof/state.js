Heck, even I am still struggling with confidence from time to time. However, I found some tricks that work for me during dark times.\n\nHere’s the deal; our inner state fluctuates. We cannot be constantly happy and smiling. There are times when we are sad, angry, depressed, and it’s ok. We need to accept and understand this is temporary.\n\nWhen it comes to confidence, it is something built during childhood. If your parents and family were supportive, then you probably have confidence.\n\nIf your family was not there for you when you needed them the most, or you have some childhood traumas, as I do, then you probably have some struggles with confidence.\n\nNo worries, though. You are not doomed. You can start building your confidence if you accept you have some issues with this part. We all have issues in some areas because we are imperfect humans in constant need of improvement.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that every person has different focus points that make her confident.\n\nFor instance, some people are confident if they have money or a good-looking car, whereas others are confident if they have good-looking bodies or clothes.\n\nThe truth is, all of these external helpers for confidence are something that the inner child always craved.\n\nIn my case, self-confidence comes from being fit, wealthy, and having loving people around me. It is because I lacked these things during my childhood.\n\nHowever, self-confidence should be independent of external factors and only dependent on faith and love from within.\n\nThus, let’s see what you can do to increase your self-confidence.\n\n# 1. Take care of your body\n\nEvery person who eats, exercises, and sleeps well is feeling great. There is also an old saying: “Mens sana in corpore sano,” which translates to “A healthy mind in a healthy body.”\n\nYour mind cannot be well if your body is not well. If your mind is not well, your life cannot be well. Everything begins from the mind.\n\nThe first step to increase your self-confidence is to take care of your body. Eat healthy food, exercise regularly, set a sleep schedule, and become healthy and fit.\n\n# 2. Set and complete realistic goals\n\nIn other words, get things done. If you are procrastinating and doing nothing, your subconscious will think of you as a loser. There is nothing worse when you sabotage yourself.\n\nI also found that a life without goals is meaningless. Learn something new, develop some hobbies, start some projects. You will increase your self-confidence for sure because you know within you are successful.\n\n# 3. Improve your posture\n\nIt is silly, but it works. It makes sense if you think about it. When you stay straight, you send signals to your brain that you are open and ready to face the world. More about this  [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2009\u002F10\u002F091005111627.htm).\n\nWhen you are sad, depressed, or scared, your body’s response is to slouch and be small. It turns out that vice versa is also true. When you slouch and get small, you tend to be depressed and sad.\n\nOur body and mind are linked bidirectionally. It is the same when you force yourself to smile when you are sad. You cannot smile and be sad at the same time.\n\n# 4. Meditate\n\nThere is a lot of research on meditation and its benefits. Meditation’s primary purpose is to train your mind and be present. You are also facing your thoughts, emotions, and inner world.\n\nThrough meditation, you will develop the discipline to control yourself and to no longer be in reaction. You will become more confident, calmer, and happier. You will also be able to sleep better and focus better.\n\n# 5. Love and accept yourself\n\nJesus said: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” It means you should love yourself first. If you don’t love yourself, how dare you expect others to love you?\n\nYou are the one who spends the most time with yourself, so you better learn to know, accept, and love who you are. There is and always will be one of you in this life.\n\nDon’t be too rough on yourself and accept you made and will make mistakes. We all do.\n\nWhen you begin to love yourself, you will love the world, and what others say and do won’t affect you anymore. You will have faith and confidence in yourself.";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1633953200",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fmy-5-simple-tricks-to-increase-your-self-confidence-to-the-roof",config:{}}}(false,"Self-development","My 5 Simple Tricks To Increase Your Self-Confidence To The Roof",{},Array(1)));
