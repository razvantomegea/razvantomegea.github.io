I have no person in my family who is truly happy, nor a friend. My friends and I are young and still a work in progress, but even so, something is missing. We never seem to get enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor a while, I used to be happy with my life. Then I met people. In my shell, I saw only the beauty of life: I was healthy, and I had enough money to take care of myself. I was alone, though, but I didn't care.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSomething happened, and I realized I couldn't live alone anymore. Life without relationships around is an empty life. I started going out and reconnecting with people and, at the same time, gently lost confidence in myself.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI never understood why I lost my self-confidence and why I am still struggling to be as confident as possible. After digging within, searching for an answer, I found something interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow come I have everything a man wants in life, and everything achieved by myself, but still no confidence? Because I don't realize who I am and how much I have achieved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI realized I was comparing myself with others. I thought other people are higher than me and more successful, and I thought I was not enough and not doing enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am not other people. I am me, and I have my path. I need to accept myself as I am and live my own life as it is. I need to make my life heaven in my way. It applies to you and everyone around you.\r\n\r\n# Accept Who You Are\r\n\r\nAccept yourself as you are because you are unique and beautiful as you are. I don't mean to stop improving yourself. I mean, do what you can to achieve your goals and be happy with your achievements.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't make you genuinely happy, don't even think of trying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI see people unhappy because they spend too much time on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, and whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people traveling and exotic places and wish to be there instead of where they are now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see actors and singers with fancy close and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see expensive cars and houses and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people with perfect bodies and faces and wished they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn other words, people hate their lives and want to escape through movies and social media. It makes me sad that social media and television manipulate us into working our lives for money and then spending on things we don't need and on which we never have the time to enjoy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe don't need all the crap they lie to us we need. We need a minimalistic life with as little stuff as possible and as much quality people and health as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am not saying we don't need to aspire. We need to set goals and aspirations. What we don't need is put them on a pedestal and make them a requirement for our happiness.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPeople in Africa who have little water, food, and shelter are happier than us. They are not aware of what the media tells us we need to live a happy life and are too worried about survival than spending time wondering: \"what could have been if?\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n# Know Thyself\r\n\r\nEvery article has a purpose, not just to help and inform others but to help me better understand myself and my thoughts. I am not a writer but a reader and \"speak\" to myself too.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a lot to learn, and I am my mentor. I don't do it because I saw others doing it; I do it as a self-therapy and a growth opportunity, because I know myself better and clear my mind.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nKnow yourself and accept yourself as you are with all your imperfections. It doesn't matter if others tell you your tall, short, skinny, fat, ugly, poor, weird, or what have you. All these are attributes exist as long as you compare yourself with others.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout comparison, you are perfect as you are. If you can improve, good, otherwise, accept yourself as you are. Trust yourself and be confident as f*ck.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***";d[0]=c;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1621579989",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:b,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:c,articles:d,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:d,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthe-first-step-to-be-confident",config:{}}}(false,"The First And Only Step For You To Be Confident As F*ck",{},Array(1)));
