Stay with me as our posts are always short and concise.\r\n\r\nThere are many magic pills spread around the web that guarantee easy and rapid fat loss. I am sorry for disappointing you, but if you are looking for the easy and fast solution, you are going to crash and burn.\r\n\r\n**Fat loss is all about human physiology.** If you understand the basics (like everything in life) you will no longer waste your time, money, and energy on useless crap.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the human body is an amazingly complex machine that is influenced by the environment, so it's impossible to track everything; we can't be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut let's focus on what we can control, okay?\r\n\r\n2 major factors impact fat loss:\r\n\r\n# Energy deficit\r\n\r\nOf course, I am talking about calories. This is the golden rule, you cannot eat anything as much as you can without getting fat, regardless of how healthy it is.\r\n\r\n# Hormones\r\n\r\nHormones are, basically, chemical messengers that help our cells communicate with each other. Hormones dictate our state, how we feel, okay? This includes hunger.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule for permanent and smart fat loss is a combination of the two factors above:\r\n\r\n**Maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.**\r\n\r\nMake sure you remember this: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.\r\n\r\nThis is where all diets fail. They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.\r\n\r\nThe secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.\r\n\r\nThese foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.\r\n\r\nI will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.\r\n\r\nFor fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.\r\n\r\nMovement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.\r\n\r\n**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**\r\n\r\nSleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep, our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.\r\n\r\nAlso, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or\u002Fand fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe ideal sleeping time is from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m., but we cannot all follow that schedule. Thus, I suggest going to bed and waking up every day at the same time and make sure you sleep 7-9 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can also try some of these [sleeping hacks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fsleeping-hacks).\r\n\r\nNow we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?\r\n\r\nTo tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.\r\n\r\nInsulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.\r\n\r\nRemember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**\r\n\r\nThe question is now: when is insulin in the blood?\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.\r\n\r\nThere has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**\r\n\r\nThis is why diets low in carbohydrates (e.g. Keto) and intermittent fasting are so effective for fat loss. I prefer intermittent fasting as it is easier to maintain and it also offers many health benefits.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water. This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy.\r\n\r\nYou can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;\r\n - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;\r\n - **Stay active** throughout the day;\r\n - Have a **regular sleep schedule**, ideally from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m.;\r\n - Go **low carb** or try **intermittent fasting**.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [Do Calories Matter?
