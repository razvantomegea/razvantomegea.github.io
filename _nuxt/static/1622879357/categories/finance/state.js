He told me it was easy money.\r\n\r\n![Django Unchained Meme](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F781\u002F0*1kA9rJcHrolxKzHs)\r\n\r\nI heard about trading and the stock market years ago in movies like “Limitless” and the notorious “The Wolf of Wallstreet”, but never understood how they work.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to trade, I was wise enough to take some courses and get educated. I took the courses from  [XTB](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade\u002Ftrading-academy)  and got familiar with charts, patterns, and indicators.\r\n\r\nThus, I started trading in the demo account and made some profits, so I deposited money in a real account and started taking action. Everything went fine until I started losing money; lots of money.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why can’t I make easy money as others do? Fuck trading! It is all a scheme.” That was my attitude towards trading until I realized my mistakes and started making profits.\r\n\r\n**These lessons cost me $5000 plus $1000 lost in Bitcoin**, but I am sharing them with you for free, you lucky you. Ok, let’s see my mistakes.\r\n\r\n# Overexposed\r\n\r\nI  **traded with the money I was not comfortable with losing**. All my monthly savings were put into trading and it became like an addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter losing money I put money again with the hope I can compensate for my losses. Sound like gambling to me, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI was constantly checking the trading app, very stressed and panic when seeing everything in red. I didn’t know what I was doing. This leads us to my second mistake.\r\n\r\n# No strategy & research\r\n\r\nMy strategy was to make money, that’s it. I never implemented a backtested strategy for all 3 possible scenarios of a trend (up, down, sideways). If the candle was green buy; otherwise sell. Cool right?\r\n\r\nWell, lucky for you I have a good article on a simple, yet a profitable backtested strategy that you can apply on any market.\r\n\r\nBefore trading or investing, have a plan and make sure you understand what you are putting your money into.  **Technical analysis (trading) without fundamental analysis is bullshit**  in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple and I will give you Bitcoin as an example. All the charts and indicators indicate strong buy, but the bull market cycle is over or Elon Musk makes another tweet. The indicators are useless in this case.\r\n\r\nAnother example is buying Tesla just because the trend is going up and the oscillators say not overbought, but not considering the P\u002FE ratio of 800 (extremely overpriced).\r\n\r\n# Not diversified enough\r\n\r\nYou know that saying:  **“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”**. I didn’t know that and put too much money into a single deal which was also not a well-researched deal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb for diversification, but you can for sure over diversify. The main idea is to  **choose different markets**  (stocks, commodities, real estate, crypto, etc.) and  **buy different assets.**\r\n\r\nNow, the way I do it is by looking at the cycles and fundamental indicators. For instance, I am more invested in crypto and commodities, than stocks and real estate.\r\n\r\nThis is because I know hyperinflation is coming, I know we are in a crypto bull market, and I know real estate and stocks are overpriced. Again, I am not just a trader, but also an investor (technical & fundamental analysis).\r\n\r\nAlso, in crypto, I choose only the best from the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, and not buying tens of crypto assets. I did that and it is a wrong approach.\r\n\r\nOk, hope everything makes sense. Let’ move to the next big mistake I made.\r\n\r\n# Over-leveraged\r\n\r\nI used  [leverage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fl\u002Fleverage.asp)  without understanding it fully. The problem with leverage is that in case the market moves in the opposite direction, you are at risk of liquidation. Not only that but not using a stop loss… haha… awful shit can happen as it did to me.\r\n\r\nLeverage is the reason I lost so much money (for me, an average mortal).  **Leverage amplified my lack of knowledge, strategy, experience, and diversification.**\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what leverage is, let me explain it simply like this:  **your investment (or %price move) multiplied by a ratio**. In other words, if a market has a leverage of 1:2 (2x), that means you are doubling the price change.\r\n\r\nIf the price goes up 5%, the leverage amplifies and you are winning a 10%. Same story if the price goes down. You are borrowing money for investing. $100 invested in a 1:2 leveraged asset, is equal to $200 invested.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is, if you are a beginner or don’t understand how to use leverage, do not ever use it. The risk is not worth it.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nThe last mistake, but not the least is I let my emotions control my trading and investing decisions. Of course, no strategy, over-invested, not diversified, leverage, all these amplified my emotions.\r\n\r\n**Investing and trading must be 100% analytical**; with no emotions and gut feelings. If you can automate your trading strategy, it is awesome. Otherwise, know your plan and stick to it no matter what.\r\n\r\nRemember that  **no indicator, strategy, analysis, whatever are 100% guaranteed**  to offer you profits. It is a delusion most beginners like me had.\r\n\r\nWe are working with probabilities, and the idea is to increase the likelihood of ending up in profit.\r\n\r\n\u003E A backtested strategy, with the right amount of investment, with enough diversification, without the risk of being liquidated, with patience, and no emotions will make you an unstoppable investor and trader.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

We moved from greed to extreme fear in a month.  **The big issue is uncertainty: is the bull market over or not?**  What we know for sure is that we are in a dump.\r\n\r\nI may be a masochist, but this big dump was necessary. There were too many gamblers in the crypto space putting their money into shit coins that could go to the moon.\r\n\r\nNot to mention extremely greedy people who use high leverage or put all their money into coins without good fundamentals or without researching.\r\n\r\n\u003E “Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.” — Warren Buffet\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have been studying crypto and investing for only a year now. Until then, I have been also a gambler since 2017 in crypto and forex and I lost a lot of money. I was ready to quit, but then I decided to invest in learning.\r\n\r\nI am still in profit, which is fortunate, but I guarantee more than half the crypto “investors” are in a big loss. However, 75% of the crypto investors who are still holding are under stress, myself included.\r\n\r\nBefore we entered the crypto space, we needed to be prepared for this. I hope you didn’t think that crypto just goes up 10x and that is that — I was hoping it would; me like money.\r\n\r\nIf you are extremely stressed like me, it is because of these reasons.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose\r\n\r\nI put all my saved money into crypto. How greedy of me, right? A month ago I sold some profits into USDT and almost had all my initial investment cashed out.\r\n\r\nHowever, the dark devil from the left of my shoulder told me: “Look how everything goes up, don’t you want some more short-term profits? Don’t be a fool and buy, what can go wrong?”. Everything!\r\n\r\nI re-invested and now I regret it. I bought more than I was ready to lose, because of greed. Now, I deserve my well-learned lesson.\r\n\r\nThe money invested is also the money I need for a new well-needed car, which I should buy in a month. This brings us to our second lesson.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest the money you need in the next 3 months\r\n\r\nCorrections happen every month around the 15th day and they may last for 2 months just to recover. If you invested a few days or weeks before this correction, you need to wait 3 months just to not be at a loss or in a small profit.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in cycles based on Bitcoin’s 4-year halving. When you invest in crypto, plan to hold for 4 years and there is a very high possibility you will be in profit.\r\n\r\n# Don’t check your portfolio every hour\r\n\r\nI repeat, crypto is highly volatile and you may see a 10% increase in an hour, and afterward a 10% decrease, or vice versa. It is also a waste of time and energy.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a swing trader, you should check your portfolio maximum at every 12 hours (2 times per day).\r\n\r\n# Have a plan\r\n\r\nAlways invest or trade with a plan. It doesn’t matter which market you choose, you always need to have a plan if you want to make profits.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a plan, you’re not an investor, nor a trader, but a gambler.\r\n\r\nI am a combination of investor and trader. I use fundamental analysis to choose a good asset but also use technical analysis to know when to enter and exit.\r\n\r\nMy mistake is that I didn’t exit Bitcoin a month ago when the  [indicators](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fpi-cycle-top-indicator\u002F) told me I should. Bitcoin kept going down and it is a matter of days or weeks until the entire crypto market follows it.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is the leader, where Bitcoin goes, crypto floes (sooner or later). There are also  [seasons](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F): Bitcoin season, altcoin season, major correction, repeat. Guess in which part we are now?\r\n\r\nI expect we are in half of the bull market and a big correction was necessary to mark this timestamp. The 200D MA supports Bitcoin, whereas the 50D MA supports the top altcoins\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F60\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1686\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D chart on TradingView\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the sell volume is decreasing and the RSI is less than 20.

He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down.

He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though.

Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.
