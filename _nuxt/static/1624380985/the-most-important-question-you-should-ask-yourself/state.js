Our times require this attitude to life to prevent us from being fooled.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write something on a rock before I die, it would be:  _“question everything.”_\r\n\r\nEvery few thousand years, Gods (or God) we believe in are scientifically proven to be unmythical, and then we create another God. This fact is enough for you to take into consideration my opinion about questioning.\r\n\r\nThere is a question, however, with which I am still struggling to answer. Its difficulty lies in its relativity and bias. I believe a few people on this planet can answer it, which is one of the root causes of global chaos.\r\n\r\n\u003E Who am I?\r\n\r\nAnother formulation of this is “Know thyself,” which is one of the  [Delphic maxims.](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDelphic_maxims)\r\n\r\nSince the era of Greek philosophers, like Socrates, the problem of knowing oneself has been a priority in a man’s development and connection with the divine.\r\n\r\nI believe that we have lost our connection with ourselves, and it is a must to re-establish that connection if one’s happiness and success are goals in life.\r\n\r\nWe listen and believe what the news, social media feed, friends, family, medical doctors, and influencers say is good for us, but is it now?\r\n\r\n\u003E Knowing yourself helps you discover your purpose in life. It is independent of age, gender, race, lifestyle, and any demographic. It is the most profound connection a person could ever feel.\r\n\r\nThis connection may take a lifetime to establish, if not more. Not knowing yourself means living an empty (soulless) life without a sense of direction of what is good or bad. I know because I felt it.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little boy, I had the desire to create something that would help other people and myself. I wanted to be a hero in a way or another. Maybe I watched too many cartoons, but anyway, that desire exists even now.\r\n\r\nFor a period, I lost my connection with myself, and I had like an existential crisis, but now I am coming back on track. We all have ups and downs in life, and it is important to always get on our path.\r\n\r\nWhat should you do to get closer to knowing who you are?\r\n\r\n# Listen To Yourself\r\n\r\nDevelop the habit of listening to yourself. Analyze your thoughts and emotions in different scenarios. Understand why you are reacting like you are. Experiment with yourself. Ask questions to yourself.\r\n\r\n# Spend Time Alone\r\n\r\nIf you always surround yourself with people and external distractions, you will never focus on the inside.\r\n\r\nTry to disconnect and free your mind. Let your mind wander and re-arrange your thoughts. It can be an opportunity to meditate by being present and listening to your inner voice.\r\n\r\nDuring these difficult times, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and knowing oneself.\r\n\r\nI am not saying you should isolate yourself from people completely but only a few hours per week.\r\n\r\n# Journaling\r\n\r\nJournaling is a self-therapy through which you put your thoughts and emotions on paper. It can be a way to understand yourself better. If you do not like writing, you can record yourself. It is necessary to be consistent.\r\n\r\nI found that the best way to understand myself is by taking long walks alone. It is my time for me to relax and self-reflect. I think better when I move my body.\r\n\r\nFind whatever helps you relax and free your mind and do it as often as possible. It will change you from inside out.\r\n\r\n# Decide Who You Want To Be\r\n\r\nIn the end, we all have a choice on who we want to be. We can visualize a version of ourselves that would trigger goosebumps on our skin. We can choose to be our own superheroes and live a life worth writing about.\r\n\r\nI chose years ago that I want to contribute to the world in a way or another to make it better. I found the best way to do this is through the power of example.\r\n\r\nIf you want to master the world, master yourself. If you want to master yourself, master your thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nWhat about you? Do you know who you are or who you want to be? Leave a comment with your vision about yourself.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends. You can leave a comment on what you would like for me to write in the future. Also, how can I improve? I would appreciate it very much.";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1624380985",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthe-most-important-question-you-should-ask-yourself",config:{}}}(false,"Self-development","The Most Important Question You Should Ask Yourself",{},Array(1)));
