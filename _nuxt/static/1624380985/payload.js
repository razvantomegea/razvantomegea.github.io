So, what is this? Glad you asked. This is the Wyckoff Method. In Layman’s terms:\n\n\u003E The Wyckoff Method is a method of determining when a market is manipulated by big guys — “Composite man” — into their advantage.\n\nYou read right, manipulated. The method was developed for stocks, but it can be applied to any market, including our new crypto market.\n\nThe Wyckoff method describes two chart patterns of manipulation, which can predict long-term movement: **distribution and accumulation**.\n\nIn the distribution pattern, big guys (“Whales”, “the Composite man”, etc.) sell their shares and manipulate the market into a downtrend.\n\nIn the accumulation phase, big guys buy as many cheap shares as possible and then manipulate the market into an uptrend\n\nIn the crypto arena, Bitcoin is the market mover. Where Bitcoin goes, the market eventually flows. Thus, by looking at the Bitcoin 1D chart, we see almost perfectly a **Wyckoff distribution** chart pattern. More about the Wyckoff method [here](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![Wyckoff Distribution](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F800\u002F0*cf6ZyDFaCrld-Q8i.png)\n\nIf we look at the Bitcoin chart and the Wyckoff distribution schematic, they sure look pretty much the same.\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I sold everything with the intent to buy back at 30K or less. Of course, I may be wrong, nothing is certain. In this case, I will buy back in at 43k, after the 42k resistance is broken.\n\nNow, I won’t buy only Bitcoin. As I said, everything goes down sooner or later following Bitcoin, as we saw in May and along the years.\n\nThe last time I saw a [bearish indicator or pattern](https:\u002F\u002Frazvantomegea.medium.com\u002Fafter-the-crash-this-bitcoin-indicator-knew-it-all-along-439633cea698) and didn’t follow the plan, I lost half my money (all my profit). I won’t make that mistake again.\n\nIf I am wrong, then we are currently already in the Wyckoff accumulation phase and we will go to the moon (100k) sooner. I think we will go to 30K one last time and then go up.\n\n### Takeaway\n\nThe takeaway is to be prepared for the crypto market going down another 10–20%. What you do in this scenario is up to you. I am no financial adviser and cannot recommend you do anything.\n\nHowever, I am presenting what I am doing in this case. I sold everything and waiting to buy the dip (30k) or buying again when we have a stronger uptrend (42k+).\n\nFurthermore, you should always be prepared for a market crash by analyzing the greed and having an exit strategy.

These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment. I am curious.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

He told me it was easy money.\r\n\r\n![Django Unchained Meme](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F781\u002F0*1kA9rJcHrolxKzHs)\r\n\r\nI heard about trading and the stock market years ago in movies like “Limitless” and the notorious “The Wolf of Wallstreet”, but never understood how they work.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to trade, I was wise enough to take some courses and get educated. I took the courses from  [XTB](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade\u002Ftrading-academy)  and got familiar with charts, patterns, and indicators.\r\n\r\nThus, I started trading in the demo account and made some profits, so I deposited money in a real account and started taking action. Everything went fine until I started losing money; lots of money.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why can’t I make easy money as others do? Fuck trading! It is all a scheme.” That was my attitude towards trading until I realized my mistakes and started making profits.\r\n\r\n**These lessons cost me $5000 plus $1000 lost in Bitcoin**, but I am sharing them with you for free, you lucky you. Ok, let’s see my mistakes.\r\n\r\n# Overexposed\r\n\r\nI  **traded with the money I was not comfortable with losing**. All my monthly savings were put into trading and it became like an addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter losing money I put money again with the hope I can compensate for my losses. Sound like gambling to me, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI was constantly checking the trading app, very stressed and panic when seeing everything in red. I didn’t know what I was doing. This leads us to my second mistake.\r\n\r\n# No strategy & research\r\n\r\nMy strategy was to make money, that’s it. I never implemented a backtested strategy for all 3 possible scenarios of a trend (up, down, sideways). If the candle was green buy; otherwise sell. Cool right?\r\n\r\nWell, lucky for you I have a good article on a simple, yet a profitable backtested strategy that you can apply on any market.\r\n\r\nBefore trading or investing, have a plan and make sure you understand what you are putting your money into.  **Technical analysis (trading) without fundamental analysis is bullshit**  in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple and I will give you Bitcoin as an example. All the charts and indicators indicate strong buy, but the bull market cycle is over or Elon Musk makes another tweet. The indicators are useless in this case.\r\n\r\nAnother example is buying Tesla just because the trend is going up and the oscillators say not overbought, but not considering the P\u002FE ratio of 800 (extremely overpriced).\r\n\r\n# Not diversified enough\r\n\r\nYou know that saying:  **“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”**. I didn’t know that and put too much money into a single deal which was also not a well-researched deal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb for diversification, but you can for sure over diversify. The main idea is to  **choose different markets**  (stocks, commodities, real estate, crypto, etc.) and  **buy different assets.**\r\n\r\nNow, the way I do it is by looking at the cycles and fundamental indicators. For instance, I am more invested in crypto and commodities, than stocks and real estate.\r\n\r\nThis is because I know hyperinflation is coming, I know we are in a crypto bull market, and I know real estate and stocks are overpriced. Again, I am not just a trader, but also an investor (technical & fundamental analysis).\r\n\r\nAlso, in crypto, I choose only the best from the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, and not buying tens of crypto assets. I did that and it is a wrong approach.\r\n\r\nOk, hope everything makes sense. Let’ move to the next big mistake I made.\r\n\r\n# Over-leveraged\r\n\r\nI used  [leverage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fl\u002Fleverage.asp)  without understanding it fully. The problem with leverage is that in case the market moves in the opposite direction, you are at risk of liquidation. Not only that but not using a stop loss… haha… awful shit can happen as it did to me.\r\n\r\nLeverage is the reason I lost so much money (for me, an average mortal).  **Leverage amplified my lack of knowledge, strategy, experience, and diversification.**\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what leverage is, let me explain it simply like this:  **your investment (or %price move) multiplied by a ratio**. In other words, if a market has a leverage of 1:2 (2x), that means you are doubling the price change.\r\n\r\nIf the price goes up 5%, the leverage amplifies and you are winning a 10%. Same story if the price goes down. You are borrowing money for investing. $100 invested in a 1:2 leveraged asset, is equal to $200 invested.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is, if you are a beginner or don’t understand how to use leverage, do not ever use it. The risk is not worth it.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nThe last mistake, but not the least is I let my emotions control my trading and investing decisions. Of course, no strategy, over-invested, not diversified, leverage, all these amplified my emotions.\r\n\r\n**Investing and trading must be 100% analytical**; with no emotions and gut feelings. If you can automate your trading strategy, it is awesome. Otherwise, know your plan and stick to it no matter what.\r\n\r\nRemember that  **no indicator, strategy, analysis, whatever are 100% guaranteed**  to offer you profits. It is a delusion most beginners like me had.\r\n\r\nWe are working with probabilities, and the idea is to increase the likelihood of ending up in profit.\r\n\r\n\u003E A backtested strategy, with the right amount of investment, with enough diversification, without the risk of being liquidated, with patience, and no emotions will make you an unstoppable investor and trader.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.\r\n\r\nThus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.\r\n\r\n### How and why the muscle grows?\r\n\r\nIn nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.\r\n\r\n\u003E The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.\r\n\r\nSimple, right?\r\n\r\nIt is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.\r\n\r\n### Workout structure\r\n\r\nYour workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only **compound movements** (multiple muscle groups per movement).\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to **avoid machines**, we will be using **only free weights and\u002For resistance bands**. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the exercises:\r\n\r\n-   chest: **bench press and incline bench press** (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);\r\n-   back: **pull-ups\u002Fchin-ups\u002Fpull-downs and rows**;\r\n-   legs: **squats and deadlifts** (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol\u002FBulgarian\u002Fsplit squats);\r\n-   shoulders: **shoulder press and lateral raises**;\r\n-   biceps: **curls**;\r\n-   triceps: **dips, push-downs, and\u002For skull crushers**;\r\n-   (optional) calves: calve raises**;**\r\n-   (optional) abs: leg raises.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.\r\n\r\n### Exercise execution\r\n\r\nHow we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.\r\n\r\nEach exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on **6–10 challenging reps**, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (**1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric**.)\r\n\r\nLet’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:\r\n\r\n-   when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);\r\n-   you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;\r\n-   when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).\r\n\r\nWe will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.\r\n\r\nFor the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.\r\n\r\n### Workout sessions\r\n\r\nYou can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:\r\n\r\n-   **push\u002Fpull\u002Flegs** (Monday to Saturday);\r\n-   **upper\u002Flower** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);\r\n-   **full-body** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n\r\nI do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.\r\n\r\n### Diet and sleep\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. **Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic**.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, **lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs & egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits**.\r\n\r\nIf you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You **don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements** unless you have money to spare.\r\n\r\nFor sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday**, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.\r\n\r\nI found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me. You can try it and experiment with your body if you like. The goal was to share my experience and knowledge with you and eliminate the noise from the fitness industry.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n\r\nWe all dream of being like superheroes (Thor, Captain America, Superman, Batman, etc.) or like our favorite Instagram influencer. However, we have been fed the delusion of the perfect body.\r\n\r\n\u003E 90% of the superhero movie actors and fitness influencers are not natural and have great genetics.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be disappointed when we don’t become like them and we think that the naturally fit (imperfect) body is not fit at all. Everyone has a different version of fitness.\r\n\r\nDon’t compare yourself with others, but with yourself from the past. If you are making progress, that’s all that matters. Health and fitness is a marathon — a journey and a lifestyle — not a sprint.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Il6rHJfkWBI5eYpFyZN2ng.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\u003E 12–14% body fat year round (no editing and not good lightning)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
