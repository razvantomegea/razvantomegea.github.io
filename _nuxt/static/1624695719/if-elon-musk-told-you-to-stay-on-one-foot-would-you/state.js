He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down. He sold part of Bitcoin and no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment method for no logical reason.\r\n\r\n\u003E Before we continue, I invite you to blow up the Upvote and Recommend buttons to help more people read this article.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet, Elon Musk said that Bitcoin uses electric energy for mining coming from fossil fuels, which doesn’t match with Tesla’s green energy philosophy. Come on!\r\n\r\nElon Musk is the man who created Paypal, sends rockets to Mars, and triggers the E.V. boom. He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though. A genius like him must have a plan. Or he may just like having fun with his influence.\r\n\r\n\u003E With great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the lessons from this experience are:\r\n\r\n-   listen to influencers with a grain of salt;\r\n-   crypto is prone to (psychological) manipulation, which makes it far from adoptable.\r\n\r\n# Bear market already?\r\n\r\nIf we go below the 200-day EMA, most probably. However, I am 90% confident we will bounce back to a greater bull market as we’ve seen before in crypto.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
