The focus of this article is to let you know what I've learned from my experience and others'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are other essential things in a relationship, but this one is the most important. If you can accomplish this, you'll be happy forever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, relationships will never be perfect. Two people cannot be the same, and they need to find the middle way for them to be happy. There are periods of ups and downs, like everything else in life. I learned that **the downs are the ones that either strengthen the relationship, either weaken it.** It depends on the two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf the couple wants to be together, they will find a way to make it work no matter what. All it takes is **good communication**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf in a relationship you communicate, you will find a solution to everything. Just listen to what the other has to say and try to understand. You both have different histories and experiences, and it is ok to be different.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou were probably raised differently, have different opinions, have different tastes; it is ok. If you communicate, discuss, in a calm fashion, without yelling, fighting, or breaking things in the house, everything will work out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe **lack of communication determines the couple to have secrets**, to cheat, and treat each other disrespectfully. It may be out of fear of avoiding conflict. It happens to me often, but I realize I am better off explaining what is on my mind and chest and try to fix it. Again, calm and understand are the go-to.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo one likes to be yelled at or to be told what to do; it is human nature.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you feel your woman or man doesn't respect you, it is not their fault. People, in general, **treat you the way you treat yourself**. People feel when you don't love and respect yourself: if you respect yourself, they will respect you; if you love yourself, they will love you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy mother, the God rest her soul, had a saying: **\"Life is like a mirror: if you smile at it, it will smile back to you, so, smile!\"**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore going into any relationship, **learn to be man - or woman, respect, and love yourself**, because you deserve it.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"}]}],["articles\u002FREAD_ARTICLE",{type:"READ_ARTICLE",id:a}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:b}]]}}("the-most-important-thing-in-a-relationship","The Most Important Thing In A Relationship","")));
