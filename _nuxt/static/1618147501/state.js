This caused me to catch a virus and get sick. I had no desire to live my life, no desire to eat, and no smell or taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was to lie in bed and watch “House of Cards”.\r\nNow, you may be thinking that I had corona. No, I did not, because I tested myself with the RT-PCR test and it was negative. You are not the only one who believes this, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought I had corona, just because I had the common cold symptoms. It is a little frustrating how this fear entered into our brains. We can no longer have a simple cold without intriguing someone and panicking.\r\nThe symptoms of corona are 100% similar to the common cold and it is so easy to confuse them. I had 90% of them. However, let’s not forget there are millions of viruses out there waiting to infect us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting symptom was the loss of smell and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t have taste or smell is that I was congested. Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives. After my energy and smell came back, I felt again the taste of food, and I had the desire to move again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started appreciating just being able to taste my food and coffee. I was also happy I didn’t have to be quarantined for 14 days just when good weather starter to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness is good sometimes because it forces us to stop, meditate, and appreciate the little things more. I also learned I am not invincible just because I am young and have a balanced lifestyle.

I am a nobody in other words. Why should you listen to me? You shouldn’t, that is the whole point.\r\n\r\nYou should take what I and anyone else writes and says with a grain of salt. Always listen or read, but do your research afterward.\r\n\r\nWhat I am writing is from my own experience and research. I am trying to sell nothing. I struggled with losing body fat in a both simple — but hard — and easy — but complicated and expensive — manner.\r\n\r\nI have been following Greg Doucette, AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, and Vitruvian physique on YouTube, plus reading BodyRecomposition’s [“Fat Loss Fundamentals”](https:\u002F\u002Fbodyrecomposition.com\u002Ffat-loss\u002F4-fat-loss-fundamentals), plus my own experience, and found the same principles.\r\n\r\n\u003E More calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat gain, whereas fewer calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat loss.\r\n\r\nNow, on paper, it is very simple, but we don’t live on paper. We have hormones that dictate our hunger and satiety which may or may not helps us in our fat loss journey.\r\n\r\nSome people are satisfied and stay full for longer periods with less food, whereas others (like me) need a lot of food to be full. It’s genetics and it sucks. I need to eat 3kg of food per day to be full. Imagine that!\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*i-ThPpnYX9QZCDvmC7Q7Ow.jpeg)\r\n\r\n[Meals from Bodily on the day of this writing](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002FHW8fZXHoS8eAFH5ejbwr9OZJsA62\u002Fdiet\u002F2021-04-04)\r\n\r\nThe hunger hormones also change depending on your lifestyle. Poor sleep, alcohol, stress, sugar, low fiber, and protein diet, etc. make us hungrier and less full.\r\n\r\nWe can force ourselves to eat in a calorie deficit for the short term through calorie counting, but in the long term, we will fail. We may also not be able to track always everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, [lifestyle tracking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) is required in the beginning to increase awareness of how much energy you burn through different exercises, how much energy, and how many nutrients different foods have.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to make the process as enjoyable as possible, because it is a life-long process. If you don’t see it this way, you shouldn’t even consider it.\r\n\r\nEnough chit-chat; let’s get to business!\r\n\r\n### The technical\r\n\r\n1.  Know how much you burn at rest (resting metabolic rate);\r\n2.  Know how much you burn through physical movement;\r\n3.  Know how much you eat weekly;\r\n4.  Be in a 10% weekly caloric deficit.\r\n\r\nTo know all of this, you can use [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F). I use it to track my entire lifestyle and it does all the complex calculations for you.\r\n\r\nNow, to make the steps above easier and more natural, let’s see some further steps.\r\n\r\n### The natural\r\n\r\n1.  Eat foods low in calories and high in volume (high protein, fiber, and water content, and low-fat content);\r\n2.  Avoid trigger foods (foods you can’t stop from eating);\r\n3.  Get a good 7–9h sleep every night;\r\n4.  Drink a lot of water;\r\n5.  Eat before drinking alcohol, not after or while drinking;\r\n6.  Move every day.\r\n\r\nThese final steps are something you can do without any phone, just using your common sense. However, you still need in the beginning to track your sleep, movement and eating. After a period of practice, you will eyeball on everything.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

Just because it is available on a DEX like Uniswap doesn’t mean you should swap your money for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, each stock has some fundamentals that can be analyzed and help you better understand if the stock (company) is worth investing in (e.g. financials, niche, CEO, vision, etc.).\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies also have  some fundamentals that can be analyzed. If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmarketcap.com\u002F). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.intotheblock.com\u002F)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cryptoratingcouncil.com\u002Fasset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Fbitcoin-rainbow-chart\u002F). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002F)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I choose crypto assets in the top 50 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n2.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n3.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n4.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n5.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n6.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n7.  I make sure the assets have high volume;\r\n8.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n10.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

The idea was that the calories they provide are less than the calories required to digest them. In other words, they have negative calories. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n### Thermic effect of food\r\n\r\nYes, all foods require energy to be digested. The idea is called the “Thermic Effect of Food”. However, no food on the planet requires more calories to be digested than the calories it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you were to eat tree barks, which are pure undigestible fiber, you would not assimilate any calories, and burn energy through digestion.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I saw a chick on the web who promotes eating flavored cotton balls to fill your stomach and lose weight. Is this smart?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thermic effect of food is based on the protein and fiber content of food. The **more protein and fiber a food contains, the more energy the body consumes through digestion.**\r\n\r\nNot coincidently, **foods high in fiber and protein are also most filling**. Hence, you will eat fewer calories, and you will lose body fat. “Calories in and calories out” is the law of weight loss and weight gain.\r\n\r\n### No shortcuts\r\n\r\nMost people look for the magic pill and latest fad to lose body fat. I was one of them and I was constantly fooled by the most popular fitness articles and fad diets.\r\n\r\nUntil you accept that there is no shortcut and magic thing to fat loss, you will never lose body fat, only time and money. The **only thing you should focus on is your calories**, it’s that simple.\r\n\r\nThe “calories in” come only from your weekly food intake. “Calories out” however are more complex:\r\n\r\n-   ~ 65% resting metabolic rate (RMR);\r\n-   ~ 25% body movement;\r\n-   ~ 10% thermic effect of food.\r\n\r\nOf course, you also burn calories during cold exposure, brain processes, and others, but the major calorie burning comes from the three above. Anything else is a detail not worth considering.\r\n\r\nTo put the grapefruit and celery into this context, let’s say your maintenance calories during the day are 2500kcal. You are eating 2500kcal and 2 grapefruits worth 100kcal each, you will have 2700kcal on that day.\r\n\r\nConsidering 10kcal of those grapefruits are burned through digestion, you would still have 2690kcal on that day, hence 190kcal surplus. If you were to have this surplus daily, you will definitely gain weight with fat-burning grapefruits.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe tend to complicate things and look at the details that don’t make a difference: fat-burning foods, fat-burning supplements, EPOC, anabolic window, not eating after 06:00 pm, exercise on an empty stomach, carb cycling, meal timing, etc. Not worth the effort!\r\n\r\nTrack your calories, be in a realistic negative balance (burn more than you consume), and you will lose fat in the long run. To make the process easier, eat foods high in protein and fiber, and low in fat (low calorie-dense foods).\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

If you’re not new to my articles, you know I am repeating the statement above in every fitness article.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember the calorie equation to avoid being fooled by the latest diet or supplement. However, it is not that easy to achieve a caloric deficit as it is on paper.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will provide two hacks that helped me achieve a caloric deficit in the background.\r\n\r\n## Turn off the TV\r\n\r\nWatching movies or videos while eating distracts you from your body’s signals. You may end up eating mindlessly, even after being full. Turn off the TV, PC, phone, or any other media device when your eating.\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes on your plate and be more mindful of your body. Don’t eat until you are stuffed, but until you are satisfied. Avoiding electronics will help you better understand the difference between satisfied and stuffed.\r\n\r\n## Slow down\r\n\r\nIt [takes 20 minutes for our hunger hormones (CCK and leptin) to stabilize and make us no longer feel hungry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fwhy-eating-slowly-may-help-you-feel-full-faster-20101019605). If you are eating in a rush, you will eat more food than you probably need in one seating.\r\n\r\nTake your time and enjoy your food. Look at eating like a meditation; an opportunity to relax and be with your own thoughts. If you are eating with your friends or family, it is a good opportunity to connect and socialize. Socializing while eating may help you slow down.\r\n\r\n## Use small plates\r\n\r\nPutting the same portion size on a small plate instead of a large plate creates the illusion of more food. It may help you eat less because you think you are eating more than you need.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is you may out less food in front of you. We usually overeat when we put too much food on the table because it just stands there in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!

It is false for many reasons, one of which is that we are different.\r\n\r\nBut why do we need to sleep in the first place?\r\n\r\nLet us skip the science for a second and put common sense on the table. Are you feeling better and more productive after a good night’s sleep? Are you feeling like a mess after a poor sleep or when you are sleep-deprived?\r\n\r\nWhen I have a good sleep, I feel I can conquer the world. On the contrary, I feel like a teenage girl during her period after a poor sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite feeling good, sleep helps us:\r\n\r\n-   lower our general body inflammation;\r\n-   making better decisions during the day, including to eat the right food and exercise;\r\n-   increase our libido;\r\n-   boost our immunity;\r\n-   boost general performance;\r\n-   manage stress.\r\n\r\nMore information about sleep benefits [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sleep.org\u002Fsleep-science\u002F), and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F).\r\n\r\n## 1. Quality over quantity\r\n\r\nIt is more important to get good quality sleep than a good quantity of sleep. There were times in my life in which I slept seven hours and a half per night and was full of energy and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nFrankly, there were other periods when I slept for twelve hours and was still tired. The reason for this is I changed my diet and started eating fatty foods and too many calories.\r\n\r\nFocusing on sleep duration changes our focus from what matters: deep sleep. Sleep was four stages: awake, light, non-REM (deep), and REM. The deep sleep phase is most important because our body heals in that period.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get the deep sleep we need is by helping our body know when to produce melatonin, the sleep-cycle hormone, before bed.\r\n\r\n-   go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time most of the days;\r\n-   avoid blue and cold light one hour before bed. Use f.lux or iris apps on your laptop and phones;\r\n-   avoid caffeine after lunch;\r\n-   keep the bedroom dark and cool (\u003C 20 degrees Celsius);\r\n-   have a sleep supplement or drink some tea with relaxing herbs.\r\n\r\nSleep is also cumulative. For instance, if you need six hours of sleep, you can get them by taking four naps of one hour and a half. There is also a sleep method called Uberman Sleep Cycle that advocates 6–8 equidistant 20-minute naps.\r\n\r\n## 2. Age\r\n\r\nAge influences how much sleep we need. The younger we are, the more (deep) sleep we need.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F0*5U3eXUOgTmus-zZg)\r\n\r\n[Credit](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F)\r\n\r\n## 3. Physical and intellectual activities\r\n\r\nA sedentary person or a person who does not do something during the day cannot have the same sleep needs as an athlete or a student who studies hard.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense that the more activities we do, both physical or intellectual, the more deep sleep we need.\r\n\r\n## 4. Genetics\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is a light sleeper. Any small noise or movement wakes her up, and she hardly falls asleep. Her father, on the contrary, sleeps like a bear in any place and at any time. I am in the middle.\r\n\r\nGenetics influences sleep, regardless of the lifestyle. Of course, lifestyle can help a lot, and we are not doomed to our genetic predispositions.\r\n\r\nSome persons sleep six hours and are fully charged, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, maybe because they have more deep sleep than others.\r\n\r\nI need 9 hours of sleep to be 100% charged. Of course, I have a regular sleep schedule and respect some of the points mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!
