My family thought the cause was hard work, but I disagree. Besides hard work and pour nutrition, my grandmother has always been a \"nice guy.\"\r\n\r\n**My grandmother always put other people before her. She never made of her needs a priority**. She also never told people what bothered her about them, especially to her children. She kept everything inside and talked behind other people's backs. Her entire life, my grandmother, was worried and was affected by anything.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that **the most critical factor of the disease is the emotional and psychological part**; the physical part (e.g., exercise, sleep, nutrition, sunlight, etc.) is the last.\r\n\r\n# Love and put yourself first\r\n\r\nFor a few years, I got influenced by my grandmother to be the same: don't love myself, don't appreciate myself, don't accept myself, put others before me. From my experience, this is a big mistake. One out of a thousand people will appreciate this sacrifice; the rest will only use you and walk over you like a bug.\r\n  \r\n**How can you expect others to love and respect you when you can't do it yourself?**\r\n\r\nNeediness is insecurity and lack of confidence. **A needy person is a person who seeks approval and validation from other people because he\u002Fshe doesn't have a clear definition of who he\u002Fshe is and his\u002Fher worth.**\r\n\r\nLoving yourself, acknowledging who you are, doesn't make you a narcissist. Narcissists keep talking about themselves and keep reminding people of how important and, let's say, successful they are (in their mind). Confident people know their values and keep it for themselves so that whatever other people think and say, they are not affected.\r\n\r\n# Your growth is your (first) goal\r\n\r\nI am still working on my confidence because I still have insecurities because of my past, so I am not a perfect example of a confident man. I am not writing because I think I am perfect. I am writing to give people hope that they are not alone. We are and always be imperfect, and everything we see on tv and the web is fake.\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing these days is to be authentic because everybody is trying to fit you in the same basket of apples. No, you are not weird, broken, weak, or hopeless. You are you and were born here for a purpose. Believe in yourself no matter what, and you will be happy. Work on your self-esteem, confidence, and all your weaknesses. It is your absolute purpose!\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
