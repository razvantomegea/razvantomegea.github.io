That is 50% of the world's population. Every year, the number increases by 300.000 people. The reason for switching from old fashioned phones to smartphones is mobile apps.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe love apps because they make our lives easier and more pleasant. Someone has to create these apps, though. These guys are software developers like me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am a web developer, and I make web apps. Web apps are cool because they are independent of the operating system and device. If you have a browser (and you do), you can run it on your PC, phone, and tablet.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWeb apps are not very good at handling heavy computational stuff. They are a lite version of native apps for iOS, Andriod, and other OS. Native means the app requires download and installation on your device.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor instance, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Medium, Shopify, and others are all web apps. The regular person sees them as websites, but they are web apps because they have logic and dynamic data in the back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, the majority of them have native mobile apps besides the web versions because of performance reasons. I was talking about the browser versions of those mentioned above.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, without further technical examination, let's take a look at what makes an app awesome from the user's perspective. We all are users at the end of the day, regardless of our occupation. Do you think developers from Facebook don't have a Facebook profile of their own? Think again!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed three critical characteristics of any app that makes it popular and engaging, which is the end goal if you want to create a mobile app.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if your app can read your thoughts. Without these three goals in check, it won't be successful.\r\n\r\n# Bug-free\r\n\r\nA bug in the development term is an error or a crash. No one likes having bugs in their app. It is not only annoying, but some bugs may have critical detriments.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nImagine having a financial app with bugs that may cause the user to lose money or make incorrect transactions. Or having a medical app with patient data and, as a result of a bug, losing patient or research data.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccording to [qualitrix](https:\u002F\u002Fqualitrix.com\u002Fblog\u002Fapp-crash-percentage\u002F), the crashes in a good quality app should be:\r\n\r\n1.  \u003C 1% per user;\r\n2.  \u003C 0.1% per session;\r\n3.  \u003C 0.01% per screen view.\r\n\r\nTest every feature and module of your app. Use the app like a monkey would use it. Press buttons randomly and insert weird inputs. Handle any case scenario and thrown error.\r\n\r\n# Fast (optimized)\r\n\r\nWe live in a century when time is more valuable than money. No one has the time or likes to wait, especially on smartphones.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGoogle recommends the page load time on the phone to be \u003C 3 seconds. The longer a page (in an app) takes to load, the higher the user bounce (user leaving the page) probability.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA good quality app works as fast as possible. How fast? Faster than last time, as Greg Doucette always says.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOptimize everything you can: images, algorithms, unused imports, or declarations of variables. Everything counts.\r\n\r\n# User friendly (easy to use)\r\n\r\nI do not like playing games because I don't have the time and patience to learn how to play. I like easy games, like battleships or sudoku or any trivia. Why? Because they are easy to learn and play.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPeople want to relax their mind when using apps. They are busy and stressed enough at work and with their daily tasks. Apps need to be easy to use and understand.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAdapt the KISS principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. Don't complicate things.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor new users, implement feature discoveries, onboarding, and tutorials to help the user get used to the app. Guide him to every module and process.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};d[1]={id:"why-I-quit-using-microsoft-office",author:e,title:"Why I Switched From Microsoft Office To G Suite",createdOn:"Oct 3, 2020",categories:a,description:"I don't think there is a student or office worker who hasn't used or, at least, heard of Microsoft Office Tools, like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

It was the first revolutionary alternative after WordPad.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMicrofost Office has powerful tools for any document, but it has a big issue many people like me don't like: it **costs $10\u002Fmonth**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat may not seem much, but in Romania, where the dollar is four times more valuable than in the USA, it is not cheap. Then again, why should I give this money when there is a better alternative: **Google Docs.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are cases where Google Docs can't compete with Microsoft Office, like when creating databases with Access. For the average user who wants only to create some tables, documents, and simple presentations, Google Docs does a good job for free.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about Google Docs is that it is **running in the browser**, so no need to download and install anything or worry about operating system compatibilities. You can also **add contributors to documents** and work on the same documents at once. You even have **version control** to see how the documents changed, and you can revert to previous versions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're worried about formats, Google Docs also does this for you. You can **import\u002Fexport PDF, ODT, TXT, DOC(X), and others**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can share with other users and so many online features; no more worries about having your document lost or destroyed because of local disk errors.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, [Google GSuite](https:\u002F\u002Fgsuite.google.com\u002F) does its job, and it may do it for you too.
