This app is the merge of my two passions and skills.\n\n**Why make something that already exists?** The truth is, it doesn’t. You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up. What if you change your phone operating system? What if you want to use the apps on your PC? Think about the hustle.\n\n### Bodily app\n\n[The Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) is an all-in-one lifestyle tracker and you can find it online. What makes Bodily unique is that it has **all the health and fitness trackers** in one app.\n\nYou also don’t need to download anything, so you can use it in your browser from any device and it is quite fast.\n\nIn the future, Bodily will be a **health and fitness social media**, similar to Strava, but with more features.\n\nThink about it, **what if you had a health and fitness profile online where your friends and your doctor can easily see your lifestyle**? Some kind of health and fitness page, which can also be private. That’s the goal of Bodily.\n\nFor now, I managed to implement only regular manual tracking, with minimal automation to speed up the process. For me, it takes an average of **2 minutes per day to track everything**. Is it a lot? Leave a comment.\n\nCurrently, you can track your **body composition, diet plan, exercise plan, sleep schedule, water intake, blood lipids, and blood glucose.** More biomarker trackers will come.\n\nYou can also **create workouts using existing workout exercises** classified by muscle groups, equipment, exercise type, and more.\nYou can use the app to **search for thousands of recipes**, using filters like diet, calorie content, cuisine, macronutrient content, and more.\n\nThe app has a [YouTube channel,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCkho_iFnebE-km74uhG3Egw) [Facebook page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fbodilyapp), and [Instagram page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), on which you can currently find tutorials for tracking your water intake, and diet plan. More tutorials and posts will come.\n\n### Pricing\n\nOf course, the **app is not free**. You have a 30-day trial, and then it will be 5 EUR\u002Fmonth. It is not expensive, nor cheap. It is the regular price of memberships out there.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

This caused me to catch a virus and get sick. I had no desire to live my life, no desire to eat, and no smell or taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was to lie in bed and watch “House of Cards”.\r\nNow, you may be thinking that I had corona. No, I did not, because I tested myself with the RT-PCR test and it was negative. You are not the only one who believes this, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought I had corona, just because I had the common cold symptoms. It is a little frustrating how this fear entered into our brains. We can no longer have a simple cold without intriguing someone and panicking.\r\nThe symptoms of corona are 100% similar to the common cold and it is so easy to confuse them. I had 90% of them. However, let’s not forget there are millions of viruses out there waiting to infect us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting symptom was the loss of smell and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t have taste or smell is that I was congested. Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives. After my energy and smell came back, I felt again the taste of food, and I had the desire to move again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started appreciating just being able to taste my food and coffee. I was also happy I didn’t have to be quarantined for 14 days just when good weather starter to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness is good sometimes because it forces us to stop, meditate, and appreciate the little things more. I also learned I am not invincible just because I am young and have a balanced lifestyle.

It is false for many reasons, one of which is that we are different.\r\n\r\nBut why do we need to sleep in the first place?\r\n\r\nLet us skip the science for a second and put common sense on the table. Are you feeling better and more productive after a good night’s sleep? Are you feeling like a mess after a poor sleep or when you are sleep-deprived?\r\n\r\nWhen I have a good sleep, I feel I can conquer the world. On the contrary, I feel like a teenage girl during her period after a poor sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite feeling good, sleep helps us:\r\n\r\n-   lower our general body inflammation;\r\n-   making better decisions during the day, including to eat the right food and exercise;\r\n-   increase our libido;\r\n-   boost our immunity;\r\n-   boost general performance;\r\n-   manage stress.\r\n\r\nMore information about sleep benefits [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sleep.org\u002Fsleep-science\u002F), and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F).\r\n\r\n## 1. Quality over quantity\r\n\r\nIt is more important to get good quality sleep than a good quantity of sleep. There were times in my life in which I slept seven hours and a half per night and was full of energy and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nFrankly, there were other periods when I slept for twelve hours and was still tired. The reason for this is I changed my diet and started eating fatty foods and too many calories.\r\n\r\nFocusing on sleep duration changes our focus from what matters: deep sleep. Sleep was four stages: awake, light, non-REM (deep), and REM. The deep sleep phase is most important because our body heals in that period.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get the deep sleep we need is by helping our body know when to produce melatonin, the sleep-cycle hormone, before bed.\r\n\r\n-   go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time most of the days;\r\n-   avoid blue and cold light one hour before bed. Use f.lux or iris apps on your laptop and phones;\r\n-   avoid caffeine after lunch;\r\n-   keep the bedroom dark and cool (\u003C 20 degrees Celsius);\r\n-   have a sleep supplement or drink some tea with relaxing herbs.\r\n\r\nSleep is also cumulative. For instance, if you need six hours of sleep, you can get them by taking four naps of one hour and a half. There is also a sleep method called Uberman Sleep Cycle that advocates 6–8 equidistant 20-minute naps.\r\n\r\n## 2. Age\r\n\r\nAge influences how much sleep we need. The younger we are, the more (deep) sleep we need.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F0*5U3eXUOgTmus-zZg)\r\n\r\n[Credit](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F)\r\n\r\n## 3. Physical and intellectual activities\r\n\r\nA sedentary person or a person who does not do something during the day cannot have the same sleep needs as an athlete or a student who studies hard.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense that the more activities we do, both physical or intellectual, the more deep sleep we need.\r\n\r\n## 4. Genetics\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is a light sleeper. Any small noise or movement wakes her up, and she hardly falls asleep. Her father, on the contrary, sleeps like a bear in any place and at any time. I am in the middle.\r\n\r\nGenetics influences sleep, regardless of the lifestyle. Of course, lifestyle can help a lot, and we are not doomed to our genetic predispositions.\r\n\r\nSome persons sleep six hours and are fully charged, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, maybe because they have more deep sleep than others.\r\n\r\nI need 9 hours of sleep to be 100% charged. Of course, I have a regular sleep schedule and respect some of the points mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[5]={id:"why-walking-is-the-best-exercise",author:a,title:"Why Walking Is The Best Exercise",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2020",categories:c,description:"I am a big fan of walking.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n## Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n## No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n## Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n## Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n## Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.
