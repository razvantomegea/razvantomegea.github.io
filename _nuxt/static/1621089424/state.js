Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

You probably learned the basics; if not, I encourage you to watch some [YouTube videos](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fresults?search_query=coin+bureau+technical+analysis), take some [courses](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade), or read a [book](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCharting-Technical-Analysis-Fred-McAllen-ebook\u002Fdp\u002FB007PRECN2\u002Fref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1620459299&sr=8-1) on this topic. I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.

I had no desire to live my life, no desire to eat, and no smell or taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was to lie in bed and watch “House of Cards”.\r\nNow, you may be thinking that I had corona. No, I did not, because I tested myself with the RT-PCR test and it was negative. You are not the only one who believes this, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought I had corona, just because I had the common cold symptoms. It is a little frustrating how this fear entered into our brains. We can no longer have a simple cold without intriguing someone and panicking.\r\nThe symptoms of corona are 100% similar to the common cold and it is so easy to confuse them. I had 90% of them. However, let’s not forget there are millions of viruses out there waiting to infect us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting symptom was the loss of smell and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t have taste or smell is that I was congested. Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives. After my energy and smell came back, I felt again the taste of food, and I had the desire to move again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started appreciating just being able to taste my food and coffee. I was also happy I didn’t have to be quarantined for 14 days just when good weather starter to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness is good sometimes because it forces us to stop, meditate, and appreciate the little things more.

Always listen or read, but do your research afterward.\r\n\r\nWhat I am writing is from my own experience and research. I am trying to sell nothing. I struggled with losing body fat in a both simple — but hard — and easy — but complicated and expensive — manner.\r\n\r\nI have been following Greg Doucette, AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, and Vitruvian physique on YouTube, plus reading BodyRecomposition’s [“Fat Loss Fundamentals”](https:\u002F\u002Fbodyrecomposition.com\u002Ffat-loss\u002F4-fat-loss-fundamentals), plus my own experience, and found the same principles.\r\n\r\n\u003E More calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat gain, whereas fewer calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat loss.\r\n\r\nNow, on paper, it is very simple, but we don’t live on paper. We have hormones that dictate our hunger and satiety which may or may not helps us in our fat loss journey.\r\n\r\nSome people are satisfied and stay full for longer periods with less food, whereas others (like me) need a lot of food to be full. It’s genetics and it sucks. I need to eat 3kg of food per day to be full.

Poor sleep, alcohol, stress, sugar, low fiber, and protein diet, etc. make us hungrier and less full.\r\n\r\nWe can force ourselves to eat in a calorie deficit for the short term through calorie counting, but in the long term, we will fail. We may also not be able to track always everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, [lifestyle tracking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) is required in the beginning to increase awareness of how much energy you burn through different exercises, how much energy, and how many nutrients different foods have.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to make the process as enjoyable as possible, because it is a life-long process. If you don’t see it this way, you shouldn’t even consider it.\r\n\r\nEnough chit-chat; let’s get to business!\r\n\r\n### The technical\r\n\r\n1.  Know how much you burn at rest (resting metabolic rate);\r\n2.  Know how much you burn through physical movement;\r\n3.  Know how much you eat weekly;\r\n4.  Be in a 10% weekly caloric deficit.\r\n\r\nTo know all of this, you can use [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F).

Eat foods low in calories and high in volume (high protein, fiber, and water content, and low-fat content);\r\n2.  Avoid trigger foods (foods you can’t stop from eating);\r\n3.  Get a good 7–9h sleep every night;\r\n4.  Drink a lot of water;\r\n5.  Eat before drinking alcohol, not after or while drinking;\r\n6.  Move every day.\r\n\r\nThese final steps are something you can do without any phone, just using your common sense. However, you still need in the beginning to track your sleep, movement and eating. After a period of practice, you will eyeball on everything.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

Just because it is available on a DEX like Uniswap doesn’t mean you should swap your money for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, each stock has some fundamentals that can be analyzed and help you better understand if the stock (company) is worth investing in (e.g. financials, niche, CEO, vision, etc.).\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies also have  some fundamentals that can be analyzed. If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmarketcap.com\u002F). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.intotheblock.com\u002F)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cryptoratingcouncil.com\u002Fasset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Fbitcoin-rainbow-chart\u002F). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002F)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I choose crypto assets in the top 50 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n2.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n3.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n4.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n5.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n6.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n7.  I make sure the assets have high volume;\r\n8.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n10.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

The idea was that the calories they provide are less than the calories required to digest them. In other words, they have negative calories. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n### Thermic effect of food\r\n\r\nYes, all foods require energy to be digested. The idea is called the “Thermic Effect of Food”. However, no food on the planet requires more calories to be digested than the calories it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you were to eat tree barks, which are pure undigestible fiber, you would not assimilate any calories, and burn energy through digestion.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I saw a chick on the web who promotes eating flavored cotton balls to fill your stomach and lose weight. Is this smart?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thermic effect of food is based on the protein and fiber content of food. The **more protein and fiber a food contains, the more energy the body consumes through digestion.**\r\n\r\nNot coincidently, **foods high in fiber and protein are also most filling**. Hence, you will eat fewer calories, and you will lose body fat. “Calories in and calories out” is the law of weight loss and weight gain.\r\n\r\n### No shortcuts\r\n\r\nMost people look for the magic pill and latest fad to lose body fat. I was one of them and I was constantly fooled by the most popular fitness articles and fad diets.\r\n\r\nUntil you accept that there is no shortcut and magic thing to fat loss, you will never lose body fat, only time and money. The **only thing you should focus on is your calories**, it’s that simple.\r\n\r\nThe “calories in” come only from your weekly food intake. “Calories out” however are more complex:\r\n\r\n-   ~ 65% resting metabolic rate (RMR);\r\n-   ~ 25% body movement;\r\n-   ~ 10% thermic effect of food.\r\n\r\nOf course, you also burn calories during cold exposure, brain processes, and others, but the major calorie burning comes from the three above. Anything else is a detail not worth considering.\r\n\r\nTo put the grapefruit and celery into this context, let’s say your maintenance calories during the day are 2500kcal. You are eating 2500kcal and 2 grapefruits worth 100kcal each, you will have 2700kcal on that day.\r\n\r\nConsidering 10kcal of those grapefruits are burned through digestion, you would still have 2690kcal on that day, hence 190kcal surplus. If you were to have this surplus daily, you will definitely gain weight with fat-burning grapefruits.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe tend to complicate things and look at the details that don’t make a difference: fat-burning foods, fat-burning supplements, EPOC, anabolic window, not eating after 06:00 pm, exercise on an empty stomach, carb cycling, meal timing, etc. Not worth the effort!\r\n\r\nTrack your calories, be in a realistic negative balance (burn more than you consume), and you will lose fat in the long run.
