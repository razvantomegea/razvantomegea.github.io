I eat five whole eggs and six egg whites every day in the morning. No, **egg yolks don't raise your cholesterol**. People with high cholesterol have high cholesterol without even eating a lot of cholesterol (I said cholesterol too many times on one sentence).\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, if you eat 15 egg yolks every day may not be healthy; everything in excess is unhealthy.\r\n\r\nShort side note, the reason I eat six eggs white is for calories and protein. Egg whites have fewer calories and more protein than egg yolks.\r\n\r\nMake sure your eggs are **free-range (code 1) or organic (code 0)**. I found that organic eggs are not so different, if not worse, than free-range eggs. I no longer believe in organic things on this planet because pollution is everywhere, and most living beings are affected. The best choice you can make is to buy local and in season or frozen.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGetting back to the purpose of this article, I use five whole eggs and six egg whites to make my morning omelet. **I use a granite skillet** and **avocado oil spray.** You can use any oil you want, but I recommend using one of these oils for cooking as they don't get oxidized at high temperatures: animal fat (butter, lard, tallow), coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI spray quickly for six times, which is equal to two-three teaspoons of oil. I let the skillet heat, and I add the beaten eggs. Now the big secret: I let the **heat low and cover the skillet.** I cook the eggs for five minutes and then cut the omelet in quarters and flip them one by one. They look like pancakes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, you can use as many eggs as you want, but the main idea is to let the heat low and cover the skillet to avoid the temperature from leaving fast.
