The earth itself and its resources are limited. Everything is finite, maybe even the Universe; who knows?\r\n\r\nEverything has its purpose, although we may know it or not. It is why I truly believe that death is established ever since we are born - destiny. Trying to fight or change one's fate would be a mistake. The wisest choice is to accept it and embrace it.\r\n\r\nMy mother died a few months ago, and it was a tragedy, even though we didn't have a good relationship, because of past incidents. It is the reason why I couldn't cry or be sad as a son should have been. The same thing happened to me two years ago when my grandfather died.\r\n\r\n**Every time a close person left my life, I saw the bigger picture.**\r\n\r\nPeople come into our lives for a reason. When that reason is established, in a way or another, they leave, so we shouldn't fight the process.\r\n\r\nLike most ideas, it's harder to apply than to read, but in time, it is possible. **It is the only way to freedom.** If you saw \"The Lion King\", this is the circle (way) of life.\r\n\r\nI have judged my parents almost my entire life for not offering me everything I wanted, as other parents did to my (spoiled) friends, but now I finally realize it was the only way for me to become my best version. I am grateful now for my destiny and embrace it.\r\n\r\n**I feel freer than ever since I have stopped attaching to the past, future, people, and objects. Life has never been more beautiful, and I have never been happier.** Few things bother me now, not too mention people. I see the big picture.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this article is to make you realize that happiness is an independent state. You can be happy just now by choice, without the need for something or someone.\r\n\r\nChoose to be happy as you are naked because that is how you arrived on this planet and that is how you - and all of us - will leave. What remains behind is the impact we had on people's lives. That's all that matters!\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
