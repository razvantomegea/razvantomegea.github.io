If you still do not believe this, you are lying to yourself. The biggest issue with this approach is inaccuracy. We cannot predict 100% how much calories we consume and burn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt becomes less trivial when we are not home eating our prepared foods or when we don't have the time and information and track everything.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is to be aware of what foods have the least calories and which have the most.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong all foods, these two food groups have prevented me from being in shape and, for sure, millions more.\r\n\r\n# Fats & Oils\r\n\r\nFats and oils are the highest calorie foods on the planet because they are pure fat and have ~900kcal per 100g. Fats and oils are in sauces, chips, dressings, fried foods, cakes, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if it's coconut oil, olive oil, or whatever healthy oil you may find: it is still fattening. If you are cooking and need some fat, use a cooking spray; it prevents you from adding too much fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAvoid fats and oils and foods containing them in high amounts as much as possible. You can easily tell which foods contain these ingredients only by looking at them or reading the label.\r\n\r\n# Nuts & Seeds\r\n\r\nAfter fats and oils, nuts and seeds are the second-worst foods to consume if you are trying to burn some fat. Nuts and seeds are ~60% fat and have around 600kcal per 100g. Not only that, but they are low in volume and highly palatable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a blink of an eye, you finished a bag of cashews, pistachios, or pumpkin seeds of 1000kcal, and you are still hungry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like snacking when watching a game or movie, try something low in fat like popcorn (without butter) or fat-free chips. If you are drinking, you shouldn't be snacking in the first place, as alcohol increases your appetite.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you cannot quit nuts and seeds, choose the ones in the shell and don't eat more than one fist.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"}]}],["articles\u002FREAD_ARTICLE",{type:"READ_ARTICLE",id:a}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:b}]]}}("the-2-fattening-food-groups","The 2 Food Groups That Prevent You From BurningÂ Fat")));
