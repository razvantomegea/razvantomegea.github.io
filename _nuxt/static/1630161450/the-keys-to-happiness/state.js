What a controversial and delicate subject. I could ask people on the street all day about _\"What is the secret to happiness?\"_ or _\"What is happiness?\"_ and I would get a different response all the time.\r\n\r\nYou see, happiness is misinterpreted. Contrary to popular belief, **happiness is not the destination, but the journey**. What do I mean by that?\r\n\r\nWe are used to saying: \"When I will... I will be happy\". Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nWe attach happiness to an achieved future goal. Thus, happiness is a destination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a vicious cycle. How many times have you achieved a certain goal, but you weren't as happy as you thought you'd be? All the time? This is because of acclimatization. We adapt to everything new.\r\n\r\nBy attaching happiness to something we don't have, we will never be satisfied with what we have.\r\n\r\nPlease don't misinterpret what I just wrote. I am not saying you should not make progress or focus on the next level, but to not attach happiness to it. This brings us to the first key to happiness.\r\n\r\n# Gratitude\r\n\r\nGratitude is always appreciating what you already have. Better, **always wanting what you already have**.\r\n\r\nImagine this: there is at least one person in the world who wishes - dreams - to having something you do. Let's take water or food, for instance: some people do not have or afford this necessity while you may have plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why poor people are often happier than wealthy people. They appreciate the basic and simple things in life. **Poor (village) people have fewer choices than wealthy (city) people.**\r\n\r\n# Self-acceptance\r\n\r\nPeople living in communities and small villages are more connected to themselves and nature. They are authentic. Living in the city and addicted to technology makes us, paradoxically, more connected and disconnected at the same time.\r\n\r\n**We have come to believe that we should be anyone other than ourselves, a typology. It is a sin to be different.**\r\n\r\nWe are all different and we need to embrace it. **Every one of us is a single unique manifestation of the Universe itself**. The Universe evolves through us. We should accept and embrace who we are, not curse, hide, or run from who we are.\r\n\r\nRemember, **you are all you have in this life** from the beginning to the end. **Love yourself first, because people and objects come and go.** What they leave behind is all that matters.\r\n  \r\n\u003E All our possessions are just borrowed. When we die, we leave them behind and take with us our spiritual investments.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Appreciate what you have;\r\n - Accept who you are - be yourself;\r\n - Love yourself first;\r\n - Don't attach to people and things.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1630161450",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthe-keys-to-happiness",config:{}}}(false,"Self-development","The Keys To Happiness",{},Array(1)));
