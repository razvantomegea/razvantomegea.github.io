There are many guides out there on the web, so why even bother you may think? Let's say, repetition is key to memorization. It's never a bad thing to review what you already know.\r\n\r\nI believe nutrition is one of the essential pieces of the health and fitness puzzle.\r\n\r\nWhat is nutrition? Nutrition is a science. **Nutrition is the science of how food components (nutrients) transform and interact within our bodies**. Thus, our focus is on what those food components nutrients are and what they do.\r\n\r\n# Nutrients\r\n\r\nOur body requires the nutrient compounds present in food. The more nutrient-dense food is, the higher it's quality.\r\n\r\n## Macronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Carbohydrates;\r\n-   Proteins;\r\n-   Lipids;\r\n-   Water.\r\n\r\n## Micronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Vitamins;\r\n-   Minerals.\r\n\r\nWe should no longer see food as just belly-filling, hunger inhibiting substance. Food should be cellular nourishment.\r\n\r\n## Essential nutrients\r\n\r\nNow, upon these nutrients, not all of them are essential. Some of them can be produced internally by the body (non-essential). Our focus should be mostly on the essential nutrients.\r\n\r\n-   **Water**;\r\n-   **Major Minerals** (Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium);\r\n-   **Trace Minerals** (Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine);\r\n-   **Amino Acids** (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine);\r\n-   **Fatty Acids** (Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid);\r\n-   **Vitamins** (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic acid, Cobalamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Choline).\r\n\r\nIn the next articles, we'll focus on each nutrient group.
