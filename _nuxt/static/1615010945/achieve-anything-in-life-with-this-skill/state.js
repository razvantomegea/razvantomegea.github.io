Unfortunately, few of us succeed in achieving their goals. Frankly, even small daily tasks like going to the gym and eating healthy seem to be impossible to reach for the majority of people.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, those people who cannot achieve small daily tasks are also failures in their own lives. The opposite is also true. There is no successful person who doesn't succeed in daily small basic tasks like working out, eating healthy, and going to bed on time.\r\n\r\n**How you do anything is how you do everything**.\r\n\r\nIt is the snowball effect. Small actions eventually turn into more significant actions. Little habits reflect on long habits.\r\n\r\n# Self-discipline\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, self-discipline is the strongest superpower a man can have. It is the one skill that made me succeed in life and become independent and self-employed.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the simple act of making my bed every morning, or washing the dishes after every meal has made the process of developing healthy habits and achieving goals much more comfortable for me.\r\n\r\nGod, I don't even think now! I do! I have become a person of action just by doing the simple uncomfortable things.\r\n\r\nThe reason why people fail to sustain long-term goals is that they also fail at maintaining small-term, daily goals. These people even wait for someone to push them when it is their job to push themselves.\r\n\r\nBelieve me; if you're self-disciplined, you won't need motivation. You'll act without (over)thinking.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't take me for granted. Experiment yourself.\r\nExample of small, disciplined habits:\r\n- grocery list;\r\n- monthly expenses;\r\n- making bed;\r\n- washing dishes after meals;\r\n- keep the clothes tidy in the closet;\r\n- crossing the street legally;\r\n- going to bed at the same hour;\r\n- phone on airplane mode during the night;\r\n- stairs instead of the elevator;\r\n- walking instead of driving;\r\n- water instead of soda;\r\n- fruit instead of candy;\r\n- start a workout routine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get comfortable being uncomfortable. **The root of all fears is pain**. If you get used to small daily amounts of pain or discomfort, it will disappear.\r\n\r\nYou will no longer procrastinate and do anything right away. Why? Procrastination is the delay of uncomfortable actions. It is the avoidance of pain. However, if you see (temporary) pain as something useful and harmful, you will no longer delay any task. You will achieve anything in no time. Just try!\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!
