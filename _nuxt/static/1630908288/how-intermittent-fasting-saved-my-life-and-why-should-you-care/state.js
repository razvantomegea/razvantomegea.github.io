In other words, **eat every three hours**.\n\nWhat if I told you this is **the biggest bull-shit and stupidity we have ever heard and made** since our human evolution?\n\nThink about it; we are the only species on the planet that eat every two or three hours per day. Every **other species eats and stops for hours or days**.\n\nOk, maybe herbivores eat all day, but we are not herbivores. Even they fast during the winter when there are no more leaves or grasses.\n\n**Fasting is a natural process** with many benefits, and we are preventing stealing these benefits from our bodies.\n\n# Storytime\n\nI started to learn how to eat correctly in 2005 when I went to the doctor because **I was too fat**. He told me that a balanced diet should include three meals a day and two snacks.\n\nWell, I lost weight, but not with advice. I started doing **intermittent fasting without even knowing** about it. Of course, I also changed what I ate, not only how I ate.\n\nI also started playing sports — handball. I had training at 8:00 a.m., and I couldn’t eat in the morning because I would throw up during the practice because of the intensity. So, I skipped breakfast and ate when I got back home.\n\nMy first meal was at 10:30–11:00 a.m.. I also ate at school and 7:00–8:00 p.m. So, **I was fasting for 14–16 hours** without even knowing it at 11 years old. Of course, I was **also in a caloric deficit**.\n\nAs a result, I lost 20kg in 2 years. I also had a 6-pack without doing crunches.\n\n# The Fitness Industry Corrupted Me\n\nAfter years, I started going to the gym and reading fitness blogs. I read that to build muscle and boost metabolism, you need to **eat every 2–3 hours. Otherwise, muscles won’t grow but shrink.**\n\nI followed this advice for years, and I **did not have a life**. Everywhere I want I had to plan to be exactly after my last meal. In other cases, I needed to have a meal packed with me all the time. It was a pain in the ass.\n\n**I was living to eat, not eating to live.** Fitness and food controlled my life.\n\nAfter a while, I started to learn about human physiology and hormones. I came across a doctor who said we were skipping breakfast and fasting and explained why. I was interested, so I started to learn more.\n\nI learned about fasting and its benefits to health and fitness, so I applied it to my lifestyle. It was a total failure. Why? Because I didn’t track my calories. I learned that **fasting without being in a caloric deficit does not affect fat loss**.\n\nIn the end, the best approach to fat loss for me was intermittent fasting combine with caloric deficit or maintenance.\n\n# Why intermittent fasting?\n\nFasting for at least sixteen hours puts the body into a state of lipolysis, ketosis, and cellular autophagy. In other words, you enter **fat-burning and healing mode**.\n\nIn more detail, fasting can improve biomarkers, have anti-aging benefits, have metabolic benefits[[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fintermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156)[[2]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC5783752\u002F), and prevent cancer[[3]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC6938162\u002F). The last one is obvious because of cellular autophagy.\n\nThere are many other benefits if you begin to search for research studies on this topic. In Layman’s terms, **fasting heals the body and triggers fat-burning mode.**\n\n# Fasting is not for every one\n\nOf course, fasting is not for everyone. If you are pregnant, a child below ten years old, or have medical issues, then fasting may not be for you.\n\nYou should consult your doctor before starting any routine.\n\n# How I fast\n\nI fast between 8:00–9:00 p.m. until 12:00–1:00 p.m. I also exercise on an empty stomach (cardio o strength training) because **fasting does not burn muscle**[[5]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=teQIaU6wp2o&t=7s).\n\nDuring my fast, I drink only water, herbal tea, and black coffee, without milk or sweeteners.\n\nSometimes, I fast for 24 hours, sometimes for 14. Sometimes I skip fasting because of some events. However, I fast 16 hours 6 times per week.\n\nEver since I started to fast, I feel free, and I control my weight and lifestyle, not the other way around.\n\n# References\n\n1.
