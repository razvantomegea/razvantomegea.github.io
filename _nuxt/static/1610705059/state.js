Why? Because of these two laws of the stock market.\r\n\r\nTrading relies on technical analysis to predict the market. 90% of traders who rely on technical analysis lose money, according to  [Bill Williams](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=bNxt298VVOw&list=PLp9LyEgIX9p8UqlZnVAcKnOeRwSxOM6B6).\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Wolf Of Wallstreet? The character played by Matthew McConaughey said:\r\n\r\n\u003E “No one can predict if the stock market is going up, down, sideways, or in frickin circles.”\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the 10% traders who makes profit long term, good for you. For me and the other 90% of traders doesn’t work. So what should we do instead? We should cleverly invest long-term.\r\n\r\nWe should research in advance of any investment initially. Afterward, we must buy and hold for at least 3–5 years. We must also periodically analyze each investment to be sure it is still a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhy hold for years? Here’s why:\r\n\r\n# 1. The stock market will always crash\r\n\r\nWe have seen through time that recessions occur. It is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Unfortunately, we can never predict when a stock market will crash.\r\n\r\nJust look at the stock and real estate market now during the pandemic. The government prints trillions of dollars and euros, unemployment is going up, money does no longer circulate because people stay at home, but the stock and real market are going up.\r\n\r\nCheck this video from Ray Dalio on  [How the economy works](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s). He explains how the economy works and why we are in a new great depression.\r\n\r\nRecessions occur every few decades that cause the stock market to crash and come back only after 3–5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the reason for holding for at least 3–5 years. In case of a crash, the market will have time to bounce back, and you won’t be at a loss.\r\n\r\n# 2. The market will always come back\r\n\r\nThe S&P, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have always crashed but always came back stronger than ever. By the way, check my article on the  [S&P 500](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fthe-capital\u002Fthe-lowest-risk-time-proof-investment-everyone-should-choose-d22d5c9cfe56).\r\n\r\nIf we look at the historical charts of good stocks and indexes, they always had periods of lows, but then came back higher than ever. We need to accepts that crashes and bubbles are commonalities of the stock market.\r\n\r\nEven the crypto markets have periods of going up, crashing, then coming back stronger than ever. For crypto, these periods come every four years during halvings. It means 2021 is a bull run for crypto, but this is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is to stop listening to experts who say to buy now, sell now, go short, go long, or whatever. Now you know that you can’t predict asset movements based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can predict if an asset goes up long term based on scientific research. What you can’t predict is short temporary moves based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\n# How to apply this knowledge?\r\n\r\n1.  Research an asset to find if it has the potential to grow;\r\n2.  Buy and asset if not overvalued. Don’t emotionally buy because of fear of missing out based on hype (FOMO). For instance, don’t buy Tesla now;\r\n3.  During market crashes, buy more, don’t sell. You can use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to periodically buy small amounts than to buy high amounts at once;\r\n4.  Hold it for at least three years, and re-analyze annually your investment (is it still a good investment?);\r\n5.  Sell if the investment has run its course.\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

If you don’t know or believe this, you are lying to yourself.\r\n\r\nAny sustainable way to achieve this is good for losing fat for life. In this article, we will talk about the best exercise for losing fat. It is not only the best exercise, but maybe the best, easy, and simple way to lose fat.\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is? It is not what you expect. It doesn’t involve any complex or heavy movement. It is “put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down.”\r\n\r\n### Put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down\r\n\r\nThe exercise of stopping from eating is the best exercise for losing fat. The premise is simple: you can’t ever out-exercise a chaotic diet.\r\n\r\nThe average exercise session burns 500kcal per day. The average resting metabolic rate is 1500kcal per day. Let’s assume we have 300kcal per day of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and thermic effect from food.\r\n\r\nWe have a 2300kcal average energy burn per day, and it is not much. 2300kcal is a large pizza and one soda. Who can live in one day with only that food? I wouldn’t and couldn’t.\r\n\r\nSo we see that only 30% (at maximum) of our daily energy consumption is from physical exercise. The rest is from our metabolism and day to day movement.\r\n\r\nThe only simple and efficient way to lose body fat is through diet control, which is what putting the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks (or hand if you eat like a pig like me) down.\r\n\r\nYou can lose fat without moving a finger, only by tracking your meals. Exercise is not for fat loss. Exercise is for body recomposition, health, and longevity.\r\n\r\nI track my meals with [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), the health and fitness app developed by me. It is still a work in progress, but hopefully, I will launch it this year.\r\n\r\n\u003E The takeaway is this, you will never lose weight if you have no idea how many calories you are eating and burning. The moment I stopped tracking my daily energy intake and consumption it the moment I started gaining body fat.\r\n\r\nThe people who are fit and don’t know what they are eating have a higher than average metabolism or are getting full fast and with small meals (like my girlfriend). They are in a caloric deficit or maintenance in the background.\r\n\r\nI need to eat 1kg of food in one sitting to get full. I eat around 2kg of food daily to not feel hungry. I lose fat because I eat foods high in volume and low in calories, like vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products. I am fit because I track almost everything 5 out of 7 days.\r\n\r\nShould you listen to me? Of course not. I am not a health and fitness professional. I am just sharing my own experience and the lessons learned from [The Science of Nutrition](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FScience-Nutrition-2nd-Janice-Thompson\u002Fdp\u002F032164316X), Athlean-X (Jeff Cavaliere), Greg Doucette, Jeff Nippard, and Kinobody (Greg O’Gallagher). It’s your choice what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends.

Welcome to the blog. I hope you are doing well.

I am not recommending you to buy any assets. You choose what you do with your money. I am not a broker or a financial expert. I am just sharing an investment asset that has returned profits for more than a century.\r\n\r\nThis investment is also Warren Buffet’s (the best investor) [best recommendation for non-professionals](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=-GrKhUdu-YE). I don’t know about you, but I am listening when he suggests an investment.\r\n\r\n### S&P 500\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is the safest and simplest investment in the stock market. No investing knowledge and time consumption required. According to [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fsp500.asp), the S&P 500 is an index representing the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOver the decades, no or few investing portfolios outperformed this index. We also need to keep in mind that there is no need to research anything.\r\n\r\n\u003Ciframe title=\"S&amp;amp;P 500\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fDZ7A\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdatawrapper.dwcdn.net\u002FfDZ7A\u002F1\u002F\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"400\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003Cscript type=\"text\u002Fjavascript\"\u003E!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\r\n\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the chart above, you can see that the S&P has been bullish for 90 years. Of course, we have some temporary crashes during recessions, like those in 2001 and 2008, but it bounced back afterward.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 will always be there because it is updated regularly. If a company doesn’t perform, it is replaced by a better one. There will always be the top 500 companies in the U.S. Makes sense?\r\n\r\nI am investing in this index, and I wanted to share this information with you. Now, you choose what you do with this information.\r\n\r\nDon’t ever take my or other peoples’ articles for granted. Always research the information and ask questions to avoid being misinformed.\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[5]={id:"I-made-peace-with-my-parents",author:a,title:"I Made Peace With My Parents",createdOn:"Dec 15, 2020",categories:c,description:"I had a conversation with my father yesterday, and we got to a subject we should have had long ago.",imageCredit:"Photo by Wesley Tingey on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002F58CC8avpLgA",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\I-made-peace-with-my-parents.md"},markdown:"I had a conversation with my father yesterday, and we got to a subject we should have had long ago. I told him I never felt a loved and desired child and that he never did anything for me. It stroke him through the heart. He couldn’t believe what I just said.\r\n\r\nA little background, my parents divorced when I was 10, and my father raised me on his own. After a few years, he married another woman, and they formed a new family. I felt pushed away ever since.\r\n\r\nMy father was always cold and difficult to deal with. He never told me he loved me or hugged me or anything. My mother had drinking problems, and they both were more focused on their issues than on me.\r\n\r\nI associated this without being loved, but now that I heard my father’s story, and now that I write my thoughts, I realize how childish and egotistical of me.\r\n\r\nMy father was always beaten by his father, and his parents also never showed him they loved him. He also went into the army at 14 years old and made his own life from scratch. Life made him cold and unable to express his feelings as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was raised by an abusive father and in a family with issues and violence. She was weak, and because my father is how he is, she felt unloved by both her husband and her father.\r\n\r\nI judged my parents for so many years and blamed them for me being so sensitive and unconfident. It turned out it is not their fault. They had the same and even worse childhood like I did.\r\n\r\nThere are so many children raised in a hell of a family, and they turn out tougher and less frustrated than me.\r\n\r\nYou see, I learned a lesson from which you can benefit as well:\r\n\r\n\u003E Never judge a person before you put yourself into her shoes. You are most probably no better than she is.\r\n\r\nI realized my parents did what they could to make me the person I am today. I have no right to judge them. I need to take full responsibility for my life, stop the victim mentality, and live my life at full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is my fault from now on that my life is how it is. My past is past, and it is what it is. We cannot change our parents and family. We receive them for a reason, and we need to accept them as they are. We don’t know the big picture yet.\r\n\r\nIf this relates to you, maybe it's time you made peace with your parents and your past too. Or maybe you are a parent and have never shown (unknowingly) your kid the love he expected.\r\n\r\n\u003E The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago.
