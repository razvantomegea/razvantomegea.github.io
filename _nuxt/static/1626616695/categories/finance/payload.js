However, they are wrong when they say gold, stocks, or cash have intrinsic value.\n\n# History of money\n\nIn the beginning, we used  **bartering**  as a form of transacting value —  **a medium of exchange**. People traded  **a cow for two sheep,**  for example. The person who sold a specific service or good gave the value.\n\nThe cow produces  milk and meat, whereas the sheep provides both, but in smaller quantities. Thus, the buyer and seller may negotiate and agree that a cow is worth two or three sheep. Makes sense?\n\nOver time, people evolved and started using some  **common currency**  to have a more stable and standard valuation of goods and services.\n\nIt makes sense because a person may say that a cow is more valuable than a horse, while another person may say the exact contrary. People needed a  **standard value estimation — store of value**. Hence, people started minting gold coins.\n\n**People chose gold**  as a store of value because of its nature: it  **doesn’t oxidate,** it can be **modeled into weighed coins,** and  it is **scarce**. Gold has stood the test of time as the standard value — the gold standard — mostly because people agreed upon it.\n\nFor sure, there are other earthly elements with similar anti-oxidative properties and scarcity, but people agreed to gold. It is a  **convention given by people**, not by universal laws. I hope it makes sense.\n\nOver time people started putting their gold into safe deposits and received a  **paper that proved their deposited wealth**. People used those papers for transactions instead of physical gold, which was also harder to transport.\n\nThe gold deposits were the first banks. Over time, banks started giving  **papers for the same gold deposit**  when people wanted to borrow gold because people never withdrew their gold. They  **relied on the paper proof**  of gold and not the gold itself.\n\nIt is how the case monetary system came into existence. People came into agreement that the number printed on the paper is the actual value.\n\nFor decades, the paper money of a country was the equivalent of gold it possessed. All until president Richard Nixon exited from his gold standard in 1978. Since then,  **governments could print money as much as they wanted**.\n\nNote: I tried to describe the history of money as briefly as possible and may have skipped some details. If you want to learn more about the history of money, how banks work, and why our monetary system is broken, please check:\n\n-   [The History of Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002F07\u002Froots_of_money.asp)\n-   [Why Has Gold Always Been Valuable?](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002Finvesting\u002F071114\u002Fwhy-gold-has-always-had-value.asp#gold-psychology-and-society)\n-   [How Banks Create Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=O5DaC1Ujrrg)\n-   [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s)\n\n# Why Stocks Are Speculative\n\nAs we saw, commodities and cash have no value if people agree they do not. The story with stocks is a bit different. Stocks represent fractional ownership of a public company, according to  [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fstock.asp).\n\nYou may think a stock price goes up because the company’s profit goes up. We saw during the pandemic that  **although companies’ profits went down, stocks went up**.\n\nThe Buffet Indicator confirms that the stock market prices have detached from the current state of the economy.\n\nThe stock market — and other markets — went up because people started gambling on RobinHood, eToro, and other online brokerages during the pandemic.\n\nHow come people had money to invest during the pandemic? Because they could not travel, could not hang out, and stayed at home. The pandemic prevented people from spending, thus, reorienting them to online investing.\n\nSo, why does do markets go up on exchanges? Because people buy. It is the hard truth. When a  **lot of money goes into a stock, the stock goes up and vice versa.**  It is what happened with AMC and GameStop as well.\n\nAll of this means  **hype can create the illusion of value**. If most people agree Tesla has value and buy its stock, the stock will go up, and it did. It had a P\u002FE ratio (Price relative to Earnings) of almost 1000. Extremely overpriced.\n\n# Crypto hype is history repeating\n\nThe crypto hype is the new hype of the online and informational revolution. At the beginning of the century — and millennium — we had the internet hype — Dotcom bubble. In 1720, we had the South Sea bubble. Now, we have the Crypto bubble.\n\nYes, it is a bubbl**e because the market is new, prices spike quickly, and people become very greedy**. A new market is easy to manipulate through social media and online news (e.g., pump and dump or fud).\n\nAs we saw,  **Elon Musk tweets Doge and the price goes up 1000 times**. Dogecoin — and other meme coins — are a joke (literally). However, if people believe they have value, they will have value.\n\nNow, there are companies and projects with some fundamentals behind the chart.\n\nFor instance, if GOOGL’s price goes down, by just knowing and understanding the company’s fundamentals, you can predict the price will come back in the future. Why? Because the  **company itself has value, not the stock.**\n\nHowever, if everybody decided Google has no value for some reason (e.g., it steals personal information, another company is better), the company will go to hell.\n\nThe same logic applies to all markets, including crypto. I choose to invest in  **Ethereum**  because of its potential to become (decentralized) Web 3.0. I also choose to invest in  **Bitcoin**  because I believe it is a better alternative to gold.\n\n# Blockchain technology is the future\n\nThere is a book called  **“The Bitcoin Standard”**  which describes the current flaws of our monetary system and why  **Bitcoin, among other things, is a good store of value**.\n\nBitcoin is not and will not be the only crypto out there. Many crypto projects, like Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana, have huge potential.\n\nThe name  **cryptocurrency is not intuitive**, in my opinion. Crypto assets or blockchain projects are a better naming because crypto is not just for finance but for other applications in our world.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nIn whatever asset, be it stock, commodity, or crypto, money goes, the price will follow, as well as money outside the asset. This process makes any publicly traded asset prone to manipulation.\n\nThis makes you understand the everything has no value until people believe in it and give it value.\n\nIf I ask for my house $100.000, but no one will offer me that price, my price is not worth $100.000. As long as there is a person willing to pay the price, the good or service has that asked price (value), otherwise, it doesn’t.\n\nDespite the fud and misconceptions about crypto, it is here to stay. People will slowly believe crypto has value and will incorporate it into their lives. They first need to understand the potential crypto has and the problems it solves.\n\n----------\n\n_Earn crypto writing articles on_ [_Publish0x_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.publish0x.com\u002F?a=MvbmQxPrbY)\n\n_Earn passive income from your crypto on_ [_Nexo.io_](https:\u002F\u002Fnexo.io\u002F?u=601537e84f1646693701d869) _and from P2P lending on_ [_Mintos_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mintos.com\u002Fen\u002Fl\u002Fref\u002FWO9U2N)_._  \n  \n\u003E I know this article was long and I appreciate you read it to the end.

How do I know this? By looking at some fundamental market indicators and at the overall economy. We are at the **end of a big cycle like in 1929** before the Great Depression.\n\n### Pandemic\n\nThe thing is, our economy went to hell because of the pandemic, and we have not recovered. Even though now we have begun to travel again, people are **not spending like they used to**. This rhymes with what happened after World War I.\n\nIf you think the pandemic is over, think again. We will probably see **another lockdown during cold periods**. We have relaxed this summer because of vaccinations, but the percentage is still low. **In Romania, less than 30% are vaccinated**.\n\n### Hyperinflation\n\nStimulus after stimulus. The US and EU have been **printing money like never before**. Trillions of dollars and euros were printed this year and last year. This **caused all prices to go up.**\n\nWe see the effect of hyperinflation and **high prices in commodities**: gold, silver, copper, oil, food products, etc.\n\n### The Buffet Indicator\n\n[The Buffet Indicator](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.currentmarketvaluation.com\u002Fmodels\u002Fbuffett-indicator.php) evaluates the US stock market. Currently, it is **strongly overvalued**. The rationale is simple, **people without jobs switched to online gambling**, which is what investment has become this year and last year.\n\nThe stock prices have been going up, while the GDP has been going down. We have never seen such disconnection in the stock market. If you look at the P\u002FE ratio of most stocks, even at the S&P 500, it is high and indicates overvaluation.\n\n### Overpriced real-estate\n\nHave you seen the prices of real estate in the past two years? The reason for this is that [**people have stopped selling their houses**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.realtor.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fdecember-2020-data\u002F) since the pandemic. By the law of supply and demand, **low supply and high demand** increase the price.\n\nBut why would people want to buy a house during the pandemic? Because of all-time  [**low mortgage rates**](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.freddiemac.com\u002Fpmms\u002F)**.**\n\nNot only this, but the **prices of the building materials have also increased** a lot, besides inflation.\n\n### Crypto cycles\n\nThe crypto market flows according to the supply and demand of Bitcoin. **Every four years, the bitcoin reward for mining is cut in half (halving)**. The Bitcoin halving decreases the production of Bitcoin, hence, lower supply.\n\nAfter every Bitcoin halving, the crypto market starts the bull run, and everything goes up. Until Bitcoin is dethroned by Ethereum, we will still see these 4-year cycles.\n\nBecause of its scarcity, it [**follows the stock-to-flow model**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F).

Afterward, it will crash along with the entire crypto market.\n\nYou can find more Bitcoin evaluation tools [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002F).\n\n### Takeaways\n\n**I am not a financial adviser,** so I cannot recommend doing something with your money, but I will tell you my strategy.\n\n**I am not an investor, but a long-term trader**. I enter a long or short position which may last for months if the trend is strong. I am bullish on most markets, but for the short term. I am always **prepared to exit when the trend reverses, even on a small loss.**\n\nIf I were to be an investor, I would invest only the money I don’t need for the next 5 years. Also, I would **dollar cost average every month**.\n\nI would buy more during crashes and **never invest when an asset is overpriced**.

It seems I was right. Bitcoin went down to 29K, and the crypto market followed.\n\nOf course, I bought Bitcoin at 29K and afterward at 34K, as you see in the chart. I also bought ETH at 1.9K.\n\n### The Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nBuying Bitcoin at 34K was a mistake because I thought, at first, that we are in **Phase C of the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic**. However, a more careful chart analysis revealed that we are most probably — not for sure — in **Phase B**.\n\nIn my previous article, I said that we are about to end the **Wyckoff Distribution Schematic,** and it seems we did, probably sooner than I saw. We can easily see that the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic has begun, and we are in the middle of it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the **Wyckoff Method,** read my [previous article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fhow-to-prepare-for-the-next-bitcoin-correction-with-the-wyckoff-method) or go directly to the [source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*C4HuCEj_xSB-bpas8-ytjw.png)\n\n[Source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\nThe image above presents the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic with its phases. I applied this schematic to the Bitcoin daily chart, as you saw at the beginning of the article, and it seems we are in Phase B at ST.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong, and we may be in Phase C, but it is better to prepare for another bull trap at 40K and then a drop — bear trap — at 27k.\n\nI think Bitcoin will follow the arrows drawn in the chart. I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**. Thus, the bear market won’t come until 2022.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nNow, I cannot recommend and advise you into doing anything with your money because **I am not a financial advisor.** I can recommend **preparing for any scenario**.

Not to mention the suicide rates.\n\nAlso, did you know that most **lottery winners end up broke**? That is the root cause of their misery.\n\nThe focus of this article is to make you change your perception of wealth. It is somehow counterintuitive to believe that making more money will make you wealthier.\n\n### Easy come, easy go\n\nIn S01:E14 of Two And A Half Men, Charlie goes broke. His accountant is trying to explain to him how this happened because Charlie was shocked. He gave a very intuitive explanation.\n\nHe made the analogy for cash flow by comparing it with water pouring inside a plastic cup with a hole at the bottom.\n\nWhen water comes inside the cup faster than it drains, the cup remains full for a while, even after the water stops flowing. Of course, this happens if the hole is only one and not too large.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, he had ten holes at the bottom of the cup, and as soon as water stopped coming, the cup stopped having water.\n\nThe analogy is simple: **if you spend more than you earn, you will always be poor.**\n\nIf you have zero or a negative balance in your wallet or bank account at the end of each month, then you are spending too much. You will not even realize this but will think you are not earning enough.\n\nSay you do find a solution to earn more money, and you succeed. Do you think it will fix the root cause of your case? In most cases, it will not because your mindset is the same.\n\n**The real issue you have a consumer mindset. When you have more, you think you afford more. As a result, you spend more.**\n\nIf you were to change your mindset from a consumer to an investor, you would realize you spend too much on liabilities and not on assets.\n\nAlso, you would see that more money equals more savings for possible investments and not more spending on things you do not need.\n\n### Exceptions to the rule\n\nI get it. You are already cutting your expenses at a minimum because you were not so fortunate. In your case, the solution is only to increase your income.\n\nThere is a catch to this exception, though. If you were to make more money, you would probably have the urge to compensate for all those years of lack of wealth.\n\nThe example above is what happened to me. I made more money than I ever needed, and still, I ended up borrowing money from others from time to time. Fortunately, I realized my issues and fixed them at the right moment.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nIf you are struggling with your money, look first at your expenses before trying to earn more.\n\n-   check your bills: are you wasting electricity, water, gas, etc.?\n-   check your transportation: can you walk or take the bus instead of the car?\n-   check your subscriptions: do you need Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Amazon Prime, etc.?\n-   check your shopping: do you need new clothes, new accessories, new devices, etc.?\n\nThe list continues but, in summary, adopt a minimalistic lifestyle. Think twice before clicking the buy button.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

So, what is this? Glad you asked. This is the Wyckoff Method. In Layman’s terms:\n\n\u003E The Wyckoff Method is a method of determining when a market is manipulated by big guys — “Composite man” — into their advantage.\n\nYou read right, manipulated. The method was developed for stocks, but it can be applied to any market, including our new crypto market.\n\nThe Wyckoff method describes two chart patterns of manipulation, which can predict long-term movement: **distribution and accumulation**.\n\nIn the distribution pattern, big guys (“Whales”, “the Composite man”, etc.) sell their shares and manipulate the market into a downtrend.\n\nIn the accumulation phase, big guys buy as many cheap shares as possible and then manipulate the market into an uptrend\n\nIn the crypto arena, Bitcoin is the market mover. Where Bitcoin goes, the market eventually flows. Thus, by looking at the Bitcoin 1D chart, we see almost perfectly a **Wyckoff distribution** chart pattern. More about the Wyckoff method [here](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![Wyckoff Distribution](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F800\u002F0*cf6ZyDFaCrld-Q8i.png)\n\nIf we look at the Bitcoin chart and the Wyckoff distribution schematic, they sure look pretty much the same.\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I sold everything with the intent to buy back at 30K or less. Of course, I may be wrong, nothing is certain. In this case, I will buy back in at 43k, after the 42k resistance is broken.\n\nNow, I won’t buy only Bitcoin. As I said, everything goes down sooner or later following Bitcoin, as we saw in May and along the years.\n\nThe last time I saw a [bearish indicator or pattern](https:\u002F\u002Frazvantomegea.medium.com\u002Fafter-the-crash-this-bitcoin-indicator-knew-it-all-along-439633cea698) and didn’t follow the plan, I lost half my money (all my profit). I won’t make that mistake again.\n\nIf I am wrong, then we are currently already in the Wyckoff accumulation phase and we will go to the moon (100k) sooner. I think we will go to 30K one last time and then go up.\n\n### Takeaway\n\nThe takeaway is to be prepared for the crypto market going down another 10–20%. What you do in this scenario is up to you.

These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment. I am curious.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
