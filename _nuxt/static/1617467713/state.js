Just because it is available on a DEX like Uniswap doesn’t mean you should swap your money for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, each stock has some fundamentals that can be analyzed and help you better understand if the stock (company) is worth investing in (e.g. financials, niche, CEO, vision, etc.).\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies also have  some fundamentals that can be analyzed. If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmarketcap.com\u002F). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.intotheblock.com\u002F)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cryptoratingcouncil.com\u002Fasset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Fbitcoin-rainbow-chart\u002F). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002F)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I choose crypto assets in the top 50 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n2.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n3.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n4.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n5.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n6.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n7.  I make sure the assets have high volume;\r\n8.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n10.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

The idea was that the calories they provide are less than the calories required to digest them. In other words, they have negative calories. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n### Thermic effect of food\r\n\r\nYes, all foods require energy to be digested. The idea is called the “Thermic Effect of Food”. However, no food on the planet requires more calories to be digested than the calories it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you were to eat tree barks, which are pure undigestible fiber, you would not assimilate any calories, and burn energy through digestion.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I saw a chick on the web who promotes eating flavored cotton balls to fill your stomach and lose weight. Is this smart?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thermic effect of food is based on the protein and fiber content of food. The **more protein and fiber a food contains, the more energy the body consumes through digestion.**\r\n\r\nNot coincidently, **foods high in fiber and protein are also most filling**. Hence, you will eat fewer calories, and you will lose body fat. “Calories in and calories out” is the law of weight loss and weight gain.\r\n\r\n### No shortcuts\r\n\r\nMost people look for the magic pill and latest fad to lose body fat. I was one of them and I was constantly fooled by the most popular fitness articles and fad diets.\r\n\r\nUntil you accept that there is no shortcut and magic thing to fat loss, you will never lose body fat, only time and money. The **only thing you should focus on is your calories**, it’s that simple.\r\n\r\nThe “calories in” come only from your weekly food intake. “Calories out” however are more complex:\r\n\r\n-   ~ 65% resting metabolic rate (RMR);\r\n-   ~ 25% body movement;\r\n-   ~ 10% thermic effect of food.\r\n\r\nOf course, you also burn calories during cold exposure, brain processes, and others, but the major calorie burning comes from the three above. Anything else is a detail not worth considering.\r\n\r\nTo put the grapefruit and celery into this context, let’s say your maintenance calories during the day are 2500kcal. You are eating 2500kcal and 2 grapefruits worth 100kcal each, you will have 2700kcal on that day.\r\n\r\nConsidering 10kcal of those grapefruits are burned through digestion, you would still have 2690kcal on that day, hence 190kcal surplus. If you were to have this surplus daily, you will definitely gain weight with fat-burning grapefruits.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe tend to complicate things and look at the details that don’t make a difference: fat-burning foods, fat-burning supplements, EPOC, anabolic window, not eating after 06:00 pm, exercise on an empty stomach, carb cycling, meal timing, etc. Not worth the effort!\r\n\r\nTrack your calories, be in a realistic negative balance (burn more than you consume), and you will lose fat in the long run. To make the process easier, eat foods high in protein and fiber, and low in fat (low calorie-dense foods).\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

If you’re not new to my articles, you know I am repeating the statement above in every fitness article.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember the calorie equation to avoid being fooled by the latest diet or supplement. However, it is not that easy to achieve a caloric deficit as it is on paper.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will provide two hacks that helped me achieve a caloric deficit in the background.\r\n\r\n## Turn off the TV\r\n\r\nWatching movies or videos while eating distracts you from your body’s signals. You may end up eating mindlessly, even after being full. Turn off the TV, PC, phone, or any other media device when your eating.\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes on your plate and be more mindful of your body. Don’t eat until you are stuffed, but until you are satisfied. Avoiding electronics will help you better understand the difference between satisfied and stuffed.\r\n\r\n## Slow down\r\n\r\nIt [takes 20 minutes for our hunger hormones (CCK and leptin) to stabilize and make us no longer feel hungry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fwhy-eating-slowly-may-help-you-feel-full-faster-20101019605). If you are eating in a rush, you will eat more food than you probably need in one seating.\r\n\r\nTake your time and enjoy your food. Look at eating like a meditation; an opportunity to relax and be with your own thoughts. If you are eating with your friends or family, it is a good opportunity to connect and socialize. Socializing while eating may help you slow down.\r\n\r\n## Use small plates\r\n\r\nPutting the same portion size on a small plate instead of a large plate creates the illusion of more food. It may help you eat less because you think you are eating more than you need.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is you may out less food in front of you. We usually overeat when we put too much food on the table because it just stands there in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!

It is false for many reasons, one of which is that we are different.\r\n\r\nBut why do we need to sleep in the first place?\r\n\r\nLet us skip the science for a second and put common sense on the table. Are you feeling better and more productive after a good night’s sleep? Are you feeling like a mess after a poor sleep or when you are sleep-deprived?\r\n\r\nWhen I have a good sleep, I feel I can conquer the world. On the contrary, I feel like a teenage girl during her period after a poor sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite feeling good, sleep helps us:\r\n\r\n-   lower our general body inflammation;\r\n-   making better decisions during the day, including to eat the right food and exercise;\r\n-   increase our libido;\r\n-   boost our immunity;\r\n-   boost general performance;\r\n-   manage stress.\r\n\r\nMore information about sleep benefits [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sleep.org\u002Fsleep-science\u002F), and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F).\r\n\r\n## 1. Quality over quantity\r\n\r\nIt is more important to get good quality sleep than a good quantity of sleep. There were times in my life in which I slept seven hours and a half per night and was full of energy and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nFrankly, there were other periods when I slept for twelve hours and was still tired. The reason for this is I changed my diet and started eating fatty foods and too many calories.\r\n\r\nFocusing on sleep duration changes our focus from what matters: deep sleep. Sleep was four stages: awake, light, non-REM (deep), and REM. The deep sleep phase is most important because our body heals in that period.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get the deep sleep we need is by helping our body know when to produce melatonin, the sleep-cycle hormone, before bed.\r\n\r\n-   go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time most of the days;\r\n-   avoid blue and cold light one hour before bed. Use f.lux or iris apps on your laptop and phones;\r\n-   avoid caffeine after lunch;\r\n-   keep the bedroom dark and cool (\u003C 20 degrees Celsius);\r\n-   have a sleep supplement or drink some tea with relaxing herbs.\r\n\r\nSleep is also cumulative. For instance, if you need six hours of sleep, you can get them by taking four naps of one hour and a half. There is also a sleep method called Uberman Sleep Cycle that advocates 6–8 equidistant 20-minute naps.\r\n\r\n## 2. Age\r\n\r\nAge influences how much sleep we need. The younger we are, the more (deep) sleep we need.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F0*5U3eXUOgTmus-zZg)\r\n\r\n[Credit](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F)\r\n\r\n## 3. Physical and intellectual activities\r\n\r\nA sedentary person or a person who does not do something during the day cannot have the same sleep needs as an athlete or a student who studies hard.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense that the more activities we do, both physical or intellectual, the more deep sleep we need.\r\n\r\n## 4. Genetics\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is a light sleeper. Any small noise or movement wakes her up, and she hardly falls asleep. Her father, on the contrary, sleeps like a bear in any place and at any time. I am in the middle.\r\n\r\nGenetics influences sleep, regardless of the lifestyle. Of course, lifestyle can help a lot, and we are not doomed to our genetic predispositions.\r\n\r\nSome persons sleep six hours and are fully charged, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, maybe because they have more deep sleep than others.\r\n\r\nI need 9 hours of sleep to be 100% charged. Of course, I have a regular sleep schedule and respect some of the points mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!

Why? Because of these two laws of the stock market.\r\n\r\nTrading relies on technical analysis to predict the market. 90% of traders who rely on technical analysis lose money, according to  [Bill Williams](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=bNxt298VVOw&list=PLp9LyEgIX9p8UqlZnVAcKnOeRwSxOM6B6).\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Wolf Of Wallstreet? The character played by Matthew McConaughey said:\r\n\r\n\u003E “No one can predict if the stock market is going up, down, sideways, or in frickin circles.”\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the 10% traders who makes profit long term, good for you. For me and the other 90% of traders doesn’t work. So what should we do instead? We should cleverly invest long-term.\r\n\r\nWe should research in advance of any investment initially. Afterward, we must buy and hold for at least 3–5 years. We must also periodically analyze each investment to be sure it is still a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhy hold for years? Here’s why:\r\n\r\n# 1. The stock market will always crash\r\n\r\nWe have seen through time that recessions occur. It is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Unfortunately, we can never predict when a stock market will crash.\r\n\r\nJust look at the stock and real estate market now during the pandemic. The government prints trillions of dollars and euros, unemployment is going up, money does no longer circulate because people stay at home, but the stock and real market are going up.\r\n\r\nCheck this video from Ray Dalio on  [How the economy works](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s). He explains how the economy works and why we are in a new great depression.\r\n\r\nRecessions occur every few decades that cause the stock market to crash and come back only after 3–5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the reason for holding for at least 3–5 years. In case of a crash, the market will have time to bounce back, and you won’t be at a loss.\r\n\r\n# 2. The market will always come back\r\n\r\nThe S&P, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have always crashed but always came back stronger than ever. By the way, check my article on the  [S&P 500](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fthe-capital\u002Fthe-lowest-risk-time-proof-investment-everyone-should-choose-d22d5c9cfe56).\r\n\r\nIf we look at the historical charts of good stocks and indexes, they always had periods of lows, but then came back higher than ever. We need to accepts that crashes and bubbles are commonalities of the stock market.\r\n\r\nEven the crypto markets have periods of going up, crashing, then coming back stronger than ever. For crypto, these periods come every four years during halvings. It means 2021 is a bull run for crypto, but this is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is to stop listening to experts who say to buy now, sell now, go short, go long, or whatever. Now you know that you can’t predict asset movements based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can predict if an asset goes up long term based on scientific research. What you can’t predict is short temporary moves based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\n# How to apply this knowledge?\r\n\r\n1.  Research an asset to find if it has the potential to grow;\r\n2.  Buy and asset if not overvalued. Don’t emotionally buy because of fear of missing out based on hype (FOMO). For instance, don’t buy Tesla now;\r\n3.  During market crashes, buy more, don’t sell. You can use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to periodically buy small amounts than to buy high amounts at once;\r\n4.  Hold it for at least three years, and re-analyze annually your investment (is it still a good investment?);\r\n5.  Sell if the investment has run its course.\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!

If you don’t know or believe this, you are lying to yourself.\r\n\r\nAny sustainable way to achieve this is good for losing fat for life. In this article, we will talk about the best exercise for losing fat. It is not only the best exercise, but maybe the best, easy, and simple way to lose fat.\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is? It is not what you expect. It doesn’t involve any complex or heavy movement. It is “put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down.”\r\n\r\n## Put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down\r\n\r\nThe exercise of stopping from eating is the best exercise for losing fat. The premise is simple: you can’t ever out-exercise a chaotic diet.\r\n\r\nThe average exercise session burns 500kcal per day. The average resting metabolic rate is 1500kcal per day. Let’s assume we have 300kcal per day of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and thermic effect from food.\r\n\r\nWe have a 2300kcal average energy burn per day, and it is not much. 2300kcal is a large pizza and one soda. Who can live in one day with only that food? I wouldn’t and couldn’t.\r\n\r\nSo we see that only 30% (at maximum) of our daily energy consumption is from physical exercise. The rest is from our metabolism and day to day movement.\r\n\r\nThe only simple and efficient way to lose body fat is through diet control, which is what putting the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks (or hand if you eat like a pig like me) down.\r\n\r\nYou can lose fat without moving a finger, only by tracking your meals. Exercise is not for fat loss. Exercise is for body recomposition, health, and longevity.\r\n\r\nI track my meals with [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), the health and fitness app developed by me. It is still a work in progress, but hopefully, I will launch it this year.\r\n\r\n\u003E The takeaway is this, you will never lose weight if you have no idea how many calories you are eating and burning. The moment I stopped tracking my daily energy intake and consumption it the moment I started gaining body fat.\r\n\r\nThe people who are fit and don’t know what they are eating have a higher than average metabolism or are getting full fast and with small meals (like my girlfriend). They are in a caloric deficit or maintenance in the background.\r\n\r\nI need to eat 1kg of food in one sitting to get full. I eat around 2kg of food daily to not feel hungry. I lose fat because I eat foods high in volume and low in calories, like vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products. I am fit because I track almost everything 5 out of 7 days.\r\n\r\nShould you listen to me? Of course not. I am not a health and fitness professional. I am just sharing my own experience and the lessons learned from [The Science of Nutrition](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FScience-Nutrition-2nd-Janice-Thompson\u002Fdp\u002F032164316X), Athlean-X (Jeff Cavaliere), Greg Doucette, Jeff Nippard, and Kinobody (Greg O’Gallagher). It’s your choice what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends.
