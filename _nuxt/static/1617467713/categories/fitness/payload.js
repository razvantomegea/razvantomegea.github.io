The idea was that the calories they provide are less than the calories required to digest them. In other words, they have negative calories. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n### Thermic effect of food\r\n\r\nYes, all foods require energy to be digested. The idea is called the “Thermic Effect of Food”. However, no food on the planet requires more calories to be digested than the calories it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you were to eat tree barks, which are pure undigestible fiber, you would not assimilate any calories, and burn energy through digestion.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I saw a chick on the web who promotes eating flavored cotton balls to fill your stomach and lose weight. Is this smart?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thermic effect of food is based on the protein and fiber content of food. The **more protein and fiber a food contains, the more energy the body consumes through digestion.**\r\n\r\nNot coincidently, **foods high in fiber and protein are also most filling**. Hence, you will eat fewer calories, and you will lose body fat. “Calories in and calories out” is the law of weight loss and weight gain.\r\n\r\n### No shortcuts\r\n\r\nMost people look for the magic pill and latest fad to lose body fat. I was one of them and I was constantly fooled by the most popular fitness articles and fad diets.\r\n\r\nUntil you accept that there is no shortcut and magic thing to fat loss, you will never lose body fat, only time and money. The **only thing you should focus on is your calories**, it’s that simple.\r\n\r\nThe “calories in” come only from your weekly food intake. “Calories out” however are more complex:\r\n\r\n-   ~ 65% resting metabolic rate (RMR);\r\n-   ~ 25% body movement;\r\n-   ~ 10% thermic effect of food.\r\n\r\nOf course, you also burn calories during cold exposure, brain processes, and others, but the major calorie burning comes from the three above. Anything else is a detail not worth considering.\r\n\r\nTo put the grapefruit and celery into this context, let’s say your maintenance calories during the day are 2500kcal. You are eating 2500kcal and 2 grapefruits worth 100kcal each, you will have 2700kcal on that day.\r\n\r\nConsidering 10kcal of those grapefruits are burned through digestion, you would still have 2690kcal on that day, hence 190kcal surplus. If you were to have this surplus daily, you will definitely gain weight with fat-burning grapefruits.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe tend to complicate things and look at the details that don’t make a difference: fat-burning foods, fat-burning supplements, EPOC, anabolic window, not eating after 06:00 pm, exercise on an empty stomach, carb cycling, meal timing, etc. Not worth the effort!\r\n\r\nTrack your calories, be in a realistic negative balance (burn more than you consume), and you will lose fat in the long run. To make the process easier, eat foods high in protein and fiber, and low in fat (low calorie-dense foods).\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

If you’re not new to my articles, you know I am repeating the statement above in every fitness article.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember the calorie equation to avoid being fooled by the latest diet or supplement. However, it is not that easy to achieve a caloric deficit as it is on paper.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will provide two hacks that helped me achieve a caloric deficit in the background.\r\n\r\n## Turn off the TV\r\n\r\nWatching movies or videos while eating distracts you from your body’s signals. You may end up eating mindlessly, even after being full. Turn off the TV, PC, phone, or any other media device when your eating.\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes on your plate and be more mindful of your body. Don’t eat until you are stuffed, but until you are satisfied. Avoiding electronics will help you better understand the difference between satisfied and stuffed.\r\n\r\n## Slow down\r\n\r\nIt [takes 20 minutes for our hunger hormones (CCK and leptin) to stabilize and make us no longer feel hungry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fwhy-eating-slowly-may-help-you-feel-full-faster-20101019605). If you are eating in a rush, you will eat more food than you probably need in one seating.\r\n\r\nTake your time and enjoy your food. Look at eating like a meditation; an opportunity to relax and be with your own thoughts. If you are eating with your friends or family, it is a good opportunity to connect and socialize. Socializing while eating may help you slow down.\r\n\r\n## Use small plates\r\n\r\nPutting the same portion size on a small plate instead of a large plate creates the illusion of more food. It may help you eat less because you think you are eating more than you need.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is you may out less food in front of you. We usually overeat when we put too much food on the table because it just stands there in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E There you have it!

If you don’t know or believe this, you are lying to yourself.\r\n\r\nAny sustainable way to achieve this is good for losing fat for life. In this article, we will talk about the best exercise for losing fat. It is not only the best exercise, but maybe the best, easy, and simple way to lose fat.\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is? It is not what you expect. It doesn’t involve any complex or heavy movement. It is “put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down.”\r\n\r\n## Put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down\r\n\r\nThe exercise of stopping from eating is the best exercise for losing fat. The premise is simple: you can’t ever out-exercise a chaotic diet.\r\n\r\nThe average exercise session burns 500kcal per day. The average resting metabolic rate is 1500kcal per day. Let’s assume we have 300kcal per day of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and thermic effect from food.\r\n\r\nWe have a 2300kcal average energy burn per day, and it is not much. 2300kcal is a large pizza and one soda. Who can live in one day with only that food? I wouldn’t and couldn’t.\r\n\r\nSo we see that only 30% (at maximum) of our daily energy consumption is from physical exercise. The rest is from our metabolism and day to day movement.\r\n\r\nThe only simple and efficient way to lose body fat is through diet control, which is what putting the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks (or hand if you eat like a pig like me) down.\r\n\r\nYou can lose fat without moving a finger, only by tracking your meals. Exercise is not for fat loss. Exercise is for body recomposition, health, and longevity.\r\n\r\nI track my meals with [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), the health and fitness app developed by me. It is still a work in progress, but hopefully, I will launch it this year.\r\n\r\n\u003E The takeaway is this, you will never lose weight if you have no idea how many calories you are eating and burning. The moment I stopped tracking my daily energy intake and consumption it the moment I started gaining body fat.\r\n\r\nThe people who are fit and don’t know what they are eating have a higher than average metabolism or are getting full fast and with small meals (like my girlfriend). They are in a caloric deficit or maintenance in the background.\r\n\r\nI need to eat 1kg of food in one sitting to get full. I eat around 2kg of food daily to not feel hungry. I lose fat because I eat foods high in volume and low in calories, like vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products. I am fit because I track almost everything 5 out of 7 days.\r\n\r\nShould you listen to me? Of course not. I am not a health and fitness professional. I am just sharing my own experience and the lessons learned from [The Science of Nutrition](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FScience-Nutrition-2nd-Janice-Thompson\u002Fdp\u002F032164316X), Athlean-X (Jeff Cavaliere), Greg Doucette, Jeff Nippard, and Kinobody (Greg O’Gallagher). It’s your choice what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends. You can leave a comment on what you would like for me to write in the future. Also, how can I improve?

I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"},{id:"why-walking-is-the-best-exercise",author:a,title:"Why Walking Is The Best Exercise",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2020",categories:c,description:"I am a big fan of walking.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n## Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n## No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n## Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n## Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n## Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.

If you still do not believe this, you are lying to yourself. The biggest issue with this approach is inaccuracy. We cannot predict 100% how much calories we consume and burn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt becomes less trivial when we are not home eating our prepared foods or when we don't have the time and information and track everything.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is to be aware of what foods have the least calories and which have the most.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong all foods, these two food groups have prevented me from being in shape and, for sure, millions more.\r\n\r\n# Fats & Oils\r\n\r\nFats and oils are the highest calorie foods on the planet because they are pure fat and have ~900kcal per 100g. Fats and oils are in sauces, chips, dressings, fried foods, cakes, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if it's coconut oil, olive oil, or whatever healthy oil you may find: it is still fattening. If you are cooking and need some fat, use a cooking spray; it prevents you from adding too much fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAvoid fats and oils and foods containing them in high amounts as much as possible. You can easily tell which foods contain these ingredients only by looking at them or reading the label.\r\n\r\n# Nuts & Seeds\r\n\r\nAfter fats and oils, nuts and seeds are the second-worst foods to consume if you are trying to burn some fat. Nuts and seeds are ~60% fat and have around 600kcal per 100g. Not only that, but they are low in volume and highly palatable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a blink of an eye, you finished a bag of cashews, pistachios, or pumpkin seeds of 1000kcal, and you are still hungry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like snacking when watching a game or movie, try something low in fat like popcorn (without butter) or fat-free chips. If you are drinking, you shouldn't be snacking in the first place, as alcohol increases your appetite.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you cannot quit nuts and seeds, choose the ones in the shell and don't eat more than one fist.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"}]}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:"FITNESS"}]]}}("Razvan Tomegea","Fitness","Health, Fitness","")));
