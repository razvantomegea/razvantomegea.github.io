Alcohol consumption, drug use, smoking, eating fast-food?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat if I told you none of these compare to the habit I am going to reveal in this article. It is a habit I used to have, but I managed to control it. My father and grandfather also have it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis habit is a habit of people who are not at ease with their emotions and lives in general. It manifests differently from one person to another, but it is there. This habit is **excess or abuse**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy father and grandfather are excessively smoking, my mother was drinking in excess, and I was eating and exercising in excess like a bulimic.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther people may be eating sweets in excess when they are stressed; others may be consuming drugs in excess. **It doesn't matter what you are doing as long as it is in excess.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Anything in excess is opposed to nature**, as Hippocrates said. Smoking is not that harmful if done in moderation. Alcohol and fast-food too. Nothing on this planet is unhealthy if the correct portions are respected. Also, any healthy habit becomes unhealthy if abused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**The body can adapt to anything if it is exposed to it gradually**. It is better to try small portions of everything than large ones of some things. For instance, all plants have small amounts of toxins and antinutrients as a part of their survival mechanisms, like oxalates, phytates, lectins, and others. If you consume too much spinach, you may damage your health with too many oxalates.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe tend to overconsume because our primal reptilian brain tells to because we may not know when we'll find food again. It is not a case anymore, but we still do it. If our emotions go overdrive, we overdo or consume. We need to control our emotions and instincts because we are superior to animals in this manner.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if you are doing something in excess? I think we all know deep inside. Our body and common sense tell us, but we are usually in denial. If you can not tell, ask a friend or a close one to give his opinion. The first step is to analyze if you have a habit of consuming something when your emotional. Even excess worrying and stressing are unhealthy as they can make you sick and unhappy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't find any excess in your life, congratulations; you are a balanced person. I still need to work on myself as I tend to overanalyze stuff and focus on the little things that don't matter, but I will become the best version of myself in time, and you with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1610875793",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthe-unhealthiest-habit",config:{}}}(false,"Health","The Unhealthiest Habit OfÂ Mankind",{},Array(1)));
