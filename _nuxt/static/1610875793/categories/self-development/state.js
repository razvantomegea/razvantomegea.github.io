I am here to end your struggle.\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or I sound like a commercial agent trying to sell you something?\r\n\r\nJoke aside, I want to remind you of the biggest investment one can ever make. It is 100% guaranteed returns, 100% risk-free, and even free in some cases. Are you excited yet?\r\n\r\nInvesting in yourself is the best investment a human can and should make. Our purpose is to grow and be better than yesterday. If we are not evolving, we are devolving. There is no middle way.\r\n\r\nBefore investing anywhere else, like the real-estate, stock market, or crypto, invest in yourself.\r\n\r\nHow to invest in yourself? Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n-   eat right;\r\n-   exercise;\r\n-   sleep well;\r\n-   read;\r\n-   watch documentaries,\r\n-   learn something new.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends.

I told him I never felt a loved and desired child and that he never did anything for me. It stroke him through the heart. He couldn’t believe what I just said.\r\n\r\nA little background, my parents divorced when I was 10, and my father raised me on his own. After a few years, he married another woman, and they formed a new family. I felt pushed away ever since.\r\n\r\nMy father was always cold and difficult to deal with. He never told me he loved me or hugged me or anything. My mother had drinking problems, and they both were more focused on their issues than on me.\r\n\r\nI associated this without being loved, but now that I heard my father’s story, and now that I write my thoughts, I realize how childish and egotistical of me.\r\n\r\nMy father was always beaten by his father, and his parents also never showed him they loved him. He also went into the army at 14 years old and made his own life from scratch. Life made him cold and unable to express his feelings as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was raised by an abusive father and in a family with issues and violence. She was weak, and because my father is how he is, she felt unloved by both her husband and her father.\r\n\r\nI judged my parents for so many years and blamed them for me being so sensitive and unconfident. It turned out it is not their fault. They had the same and even worse childhood like I did.\r\n\r\nThere are so many children raised in a hell of a family, and they turn out tougher and less frustrated than me.\r\n\r\nYou see, I learned a lesson from which you can benefit as well:\r\n\r\n\u003E Never judge a person before you put yourself into her shoes. You are most probably no better than she is.\r\n\r\nI realized my parents did what they could to make me the person I am today. I have no right to judge them. I need to take full responsibility for my life, stop the victim mentality, and live my life at full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is my fault from now on that my life is how it is. My past is past, and it is what it is. We cannot change our parents and family. We receive them for a reason, and we need to accept them as they are. We don’t know the big picture yet.\r\n\r\nIf this relates to you, maybe it's time you made peace with your parents and your past too. Or maybe you are a parent and have never shown (unknowingly) your kid the love he expected.\r\n\r\n\u003E The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now. — Chinese proverb\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[2]={id:"how-I-stay-motivated",author:a,title:"How I Stay Motivated",createdOn:"Nov 28, 2020",categories:b,description:"Every person should have goals in life if he wants to have a meaningful life.

I life without meaning (or direction) is an empty life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, goals are not enough; **you must achieve your goals; otherwise, they are just fantasies** - dreams. The only way to achieve goals is by doing the work.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs simple as it sounds, **it is not easy at all**. The only thing that stays in our way to achieving anything in life is our ability to **decide to do work**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe biggest question is **how to decide** to do the work? In other words, **how to get motivated** to get to work? You might not like the answer: you don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**_Motivation is just a temporary and limited energy burst (feeling) that helps you to do the work._**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI cannot stress temporary and limited enough. Here's the thing, \"I achieved everything because I was motivated every day of my life,\" said no successful person ever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**No one is motivated every single day of their life**. Every person would rather stay in bed and scroll Instagram or Facebook 24\u002F7. It is so comfortable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSuccessful people **decide** to do the work and **accept** it is the right thing to do. In the beginning, it is very hard, but in the long term, it becomes **automatic - a routine**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is the secret to progress in any area. **Create routines** so that you no longer need to think to do something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, eating healthily, exercising, cooking, working on my projects, waking without an alarm clock have become automatic. I've been doing them for so long, they have become something natural and fun to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you may ask: how to be motivated in the beginning, before creating a routine?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI will reveal two secrets:\r\n\r\n1.  **_Motivation is a tank that is full in the morning and empty in the evening;_**\r\n2.  **_Focus on long-term fulfillment and happiness than on short-term pleasures._**\r\n\r\nThese are the two secrets that helped me achieve anything.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always do the most important and most challenging things first thing in the morning because I am most motivated then.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always think of: \"How proud would I be of myself in the future if I looked back and saw myself choosing work instead of procrastination?\". I also hate the guilt and frustration after not doing what I need to do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI can reframe everything in a single sentence: **do the difficult and disgusting things now; relax and enjoy later.** It is my main principle and philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[3]={id:"the-most-important-question-you-should-ask-yourself",author:a,title:"The Most Important Question You Should Ask Yourself",createdOn:"Oct 28, 2020",categories:b,description:"The answer is the hardest yet fulfilling.",imageCredit:"Photo by Avery Evans on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FNOm4f0xx2bU",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\the-most-important-question-you-should-ask-yourself.md"},markdown:"I like to ask a lot of questions because there is a lot of crap fed to us out there. Our times require this attitude to life to prevent us from being fooled.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write something on a rock before I die, it would be:  _“question everything.”_\r\n\r\nEvery few thousand years, Gods (or God) we believe in are scientifically proven to be unmythical, and then we create another God. This fact is enough for you to take into consideration my opinion about questioning.\r\n\r\nThere is a question, however, with which I am still struggling to answer. Its difficulty lies in its relativity and bias. I believe a few people on this planet can answer it, which is one of the root causes of global chaos.\r\n\r\n\u003E Who am I?\r\n\r\nAnother formulation of this is “Know thyself,” which is one of the  [Delphic maxims.](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDelphic_maxims)\r\n\r\nSince the era of Greek philosophers, like Socrates, the problem of knowing oneself has been a priority in a man’s development and connection with the divine.\r\n\r\nI believe that we have lost our connection with ourselves, and it is a must to re-establish that connection if one’s happiness and success are goals in life.\r\n\r\nWe listen and believe what the news, social media feed, friends, family, medical doctors, and influencers say is good for us, but is it now?\r\n\r\n\u003E Knowing yourself helps you discover your purpose in life. It is independent of age, gender, race, lifestyle, and any demographic. It is the most profound connection a person could ever feel.\r\n\r\nThis connection may take a lifetime to establish, if not more. Not knowing yourself means living an empty (soulless) life without a sense of direction of what is good or bad. I know because I felt it.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little boy, I had the desire to create something that would help other people and myself. I wanted to be a hero in a way or another. Maybe I watched too many cartoons, but anyway, that desire exists even now.\r\n\r\nFor a period, I lost my connection with myself, and I had like an existential crisis, but now I am coming back on track. We all have ups and downs in life, and it is important to always get on our path.\r\n\r\nWhat should you do to get closer to knowing who you are?\r\n\r\n# Listen To Yourself\r\n\r\nDevelop the habit of listening to yourself. Analyze your thoughts and emotions in different scenarios. Understand why you are reacting like you are. Experiment with yourself. Ask questions to yourself.\r\n\r\n# Spend Time Alone\r\n\r\nIf you always surround yourself with people and external distractions, you will never focus on the inside.\r\n\r\nTry to disconnect and free your mind. Let your mind wander and re-arrange your thoughts. It can be an opportunity to meditate by being present and listening to your inner voice.\r\n\r\nDuring these difficult times, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and knowing oneself.\r\n\r\nI am not saying you should isolate yourself from people completely but only a few hours per week.\r\n\r\n# Journaling\r\n\r\nJournaling is a self-therapy through which you put your thoughts and emotions on paper. It can be a way to understand yourself better. If you do not like writing, you can record yourself. It is necessary to be consistent.\r\n\r\nI found that the best way to understand myself is by taking long walks alone. It is my time for me to relax and self-reflect. I think better when I move my body.\r\n\r\nFind whatever helps you relax and free your mind and do it as often as possible. It will change you from inside out.\r\n\r\n# Decide Who You Want To Be\r\n\r\nIn the end, we all have a choice on who we want to be. We can visualize a version of ourselves that would trigger goosebumps on our skin. We can choose to be our own superheroes and live a life worth writing about.\r\n\r\nI chose years ago that I want to contribute to the world in a way or another to make it better. I found the best way to do this is through the power of example.\r\n\r\nIf you want to master the world, master yourself. If you want to master yourself, master your thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nWhat about you? Do you know who you are or who you want to be? Leave a comment with your vision about yourself.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends.

In my shell, I saw only the beauty of life: I was healthy, and I had enough money to take care of myself. I was alone, though, but I didn't care.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSomething happened, and I realized I couldn't live alone anymore. Life without relationships around is an empty life. I started going out and reconnecting with people and, at the same time, gently lost confidence in myself.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI never understood why I lost my self-confidence and why I am still struggling to be as confident as possible. After digging within, searching for an answer, I found something interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow come I have everything a man wants in life, and everything achieved by myself, but still no confidence? Because I don't realize who I am and how much I have achieved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI realized I was comparing myself with others. I thought other people are higher than me and more successful, and I thought I was not enough and not doing enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am not other people. I am me, and I have my path. I need to accept myself as I am and live my own life as it is. I need to make my life heaven in my way. It applies to you and everyone around you.\r\n\r\n# Accept Who You Are\r\n\r\nAccept yourself as you are because you are unique and beautiful as you are. I don't mean to stop improving yourself. I mean, do what you can to achieve your goals and be happy with your achievements.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't make you genuinely happy, don't even think of trying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI see people unhappy because they spend too much time on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, and whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people traveling and exotic places and wish to be there instead of where they are now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see actors and singers with fancy close and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see expensive cars and houses and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people with perfect bodies and faces and wished they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn other words, people hate their lives and want to escape through movies and social media. It makes me sad that social media and television manipulate us into working our lives for money and then spending on things we don't need and on which we never have the time to enjoy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe don't need all the crap they lie to us we need. We need a minimalistic life with as little stuff as possible and as much quality people and health as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am not saying we don't need to aspire. We need to set goals and aspirations. What we don't need is put them on a pedestal and make them a requirement for our happiness.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPeople in Africa who have little water, food, and shelter are happier than us. They are not aware of what the media tells us we need to live a happy life and are too worried about survival than spending time wondering: \"what could have been if?\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n# Know Thyself\r\n\r\nEvery article has a purpose, not just to help and inform others but to help me better understand myself and my thoughts. I am not a writer but a reader and \"speak\" to myself too.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a lot to learn, and I am my mentor. I don't do it because I saw others doing it; I do it as a self-therapy and a growth opportunity, because I know myself better and clear my mind.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nKnow yourself and accept yourself as you are with all your imperfections. It doesn't matter if others tell you your tall, short, skinny, fat, ugly, poor, weird, or what have you. All these are attributes exist as long as you compare yourself with others.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout comparison, you are perfect as you are. If you can improve, good, otherwise, accept yourself as you are.

It is easy when you're living alone and isolated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI've isolated myself for five years to focus on my career, health, and fitness, and it has cost me dearly. I've lost my social skills, and I can come as anti-social. I am not anti-social, not anymore at least, but I have a little social anxiety. If I think about it, I am causing my discomfort because I don't have my food, and I am not in my habitat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy obsessions with being fit all the time prevent me from having fun and feeling good from time to time on weekends. As hard as I am trying to hide this, people can tell, and it is not cool.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, because of my trauma from childhood when I was overweight, I have come to believe that only if I were to be fit could I be accepted in society. It sucks how some childhood trauma can affect your entire life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to make a balance between social life and my goals through portion control. If we think about it, if I eat correctly five-six days per week, on day of cheating won't do any harm if done correctly. I know that fatty foods are the enemy, so I always eat the slimmest food on the table. When it comes to alcohol, I also choose low-calorie alcohol drinks and avoid soft drinks (I don't like them).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf anything slim or low calorie is available, I consume small, minimal, portions, just enough to not be impolite, because that's what is all about.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go off-road from your plan a day per week, but then you are back on track the following six days, it is perfect. **If the long-term trend is up, it doesn't matter if, from time to time, there are some short-term downtrends**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the end, we are social beings, and **we cannot sacrifice our social life for anything in the world. It doesn't matter if you are rich, famous, fit, and good looking if you are alone and have no one with whom to share your success and happiness.** With patience and dedication, we can balance everything. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1610875793",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:d,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:e,icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:"SELF-DEVELOPMENT","mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:{},articles:f,searchQuery:c,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:f,isSearching:d}},serverRendered:true,routePath:e,config:{}}}("Razvan Tomegea","Self-development","",false,"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",Array(6)));
