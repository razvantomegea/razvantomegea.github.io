Welcome to the blog. I hope you are doing well. In this article, you will discover the lowest risk asset in the stock market, which has always returned profit throughout the decades.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is for educational purposes only. I am not recommending you to buy any assets. You choose what you do with your money. I am not a broker or a financial expert. I am just sharing an investment asset that has returned profits for more than a century.\r\n\r\nThis investment is also Warren Buffet’s (the best investor) [best recommendation for non-professionals](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=-GrKhUdu-YE). I don’t know about you, but I am listening when he suggests an investment.\r\n\r\n### S&P 500\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is the safest and simplest investment in the stock market. No investing knowledge and time consumption required. According to [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fsp500.asp), the S&P 500 is an index representing the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOver the decades, no or few investing portfolios outperformed this index. We also need to keep in mind that there is no need to research anything.\r\n\r\n\u003Ciframe title=\"S&amp;amp;P 500\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fDZ7A\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdatawrapper.dwcdn.net\u002FfDZ7A\u002F1\u002F\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"400\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003Cscript type=\"text\u002Fjavascript\"\u003E!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\r\n\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the chart above, you can see that the S&P has been bullish for 90 years. Of course, we have some temporary crashes during recessions, like those in 2001 and 2008, but it bounced back afterward.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 will always be there because it is updated regularly. If a company doesn’t perform, it is replaced by a better one. There will always be the top 500 companies in the U.S. Makes sense?\r\n\r\nI am investing in this index, and I wanted to share this information with you. Now, you choose what you do with this information.\r\n\r\nDon’t ever take my or other peoples’ articles for granted. Always research the information and ask questions to avoid being misinformed.\r\n\r\n*There you have it! I hope you enjoyed it and be sure to share it with your friends and stay tuned for upcoming quality posts. Take care!*"}]}],["articles\u002FREAD_ARTICLE",{type:"READ_ARTICLE",id:a}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:b}]]}}("safest-stock-investment","The Lowest Risk, Time Proof Investment Everyone Should Choose")));
