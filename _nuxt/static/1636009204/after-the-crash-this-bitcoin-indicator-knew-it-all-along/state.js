We experienced a crypto market crash this week because of a chain of events, but could have we predict this? Seems yes.\r\n\r\nSome useful tools indicate when Bitcoin — and the entire crypto market — is oversold or overbought. I talked about this in another [article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fcrypto-research-tools-that-supercharged-my-investing-strategy).\r\n\r\nFrom all the tools, only one seems to have predicted Bitcoin being overbought since April 13th. It also predicted the same thing in 2013, around the same period (April 9th).\r\n\r\n# The Pi Cycle Indicator\r\n\r\n[The Pi Cycle indicator](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fpi-cycle-top-indicator\u002F) predicted crashes in 2013 both times, in 2017, and now in 2021. I saw it, but I was too cocky and foolish to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe good part is we are not in a bear market yet, we will experience a new boom until the end of this year. We will keep an eye on the indicator and see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
