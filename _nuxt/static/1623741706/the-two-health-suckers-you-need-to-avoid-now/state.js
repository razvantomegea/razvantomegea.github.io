Also, if I were to tell the best nutritional advice to someone, it was to throw away and stop consuming these two guys.\r\n\r\n# Added sugars and sweeteners\r\n\r\nNowadays, every single processed food has added sugars and sweeteners in it. Just read the label, and you'll see.\r\n\r\nSugars and sweeteners are also in the kitchen of every living soul.\r\n\r\nRemember this, **if it is sweet or contains something ending in \"-ose\", it is\u002Fhas sugars**, regardless of being natural or artificial.\r\n\r\nSince the 19th century, we have been consuming sweeteners like water. We are drinking sugar with all the juices out there; it is the reason for **metabolic diseases**.\r\n\r\n**_Sugar is addictive and has the same effects on our body as alcohol, but without the hangover._**\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with artificial sweeteners is they cause **blood sugar and insulin spike**, which will turn into fat. Even artificial sweeteners, although with no glycemic response, cause insulin spikes and resistance.\r\n\r\nThey are also **highly inflammator**y and **impair nutrient absorption**  **(malnutrition)**.\r\n\r\n## Health problems\r\n- **Heart disease;**\r\n- **Cardiovascular disease;**\r\n- **Type 2 diabetes;**\r\n- **Fat\u002FWeight gain (Obesity);**\r\n- **Metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes;**\r\n- **Dysbiosis (e.g., IBS, IBD);**\r\n- **Aging;**\r\n- **Skin problems;**\r\n- **Bone and joint problems (Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis);**\r\n- **Brain problems (e.g., Depression, Memory\u002FAlzheimer's, Anxiety, ADD\u002FADHD);**\r\n- **Fatty liver disease;**\r\n- **Weak immune system;**\r\n- **Cravings;**\r\n- **Addiction.**\r\n\r\n## Secret sugar names and sources\r\n- **Agave Nectar;**\r\n- **Barbados Sugar;**\r\n- **Barley Malt Syrup;**\r\n- **Beet Sugar;**\r\n- **Blackstrap Molasses;**\r\n- **Cane Crystals;**\r\n- **Cane Juice Crystals;**\r\n- **Castor Sugar;**\r\n- **Coconut Sugar;**\r\n- **Corn Sweetener;**\r\n- **Corn Syrup;**\r\n- **Corn Syrup Solids;**\r\n- **Crystalline Fructose;**\r\n- **Date Sugar;**\r\n- **Demerara Sugar;**\r\n- **Dextrose;**\r\n- **Evaporated Cane Juice;**\r\n- **Florida Crystals;**\r\n- **Fructose;**\r\n- **Fruit Juice;**\r\n- **Fruit Juice Concentrate;**\r\n- **Galactose;**\r\n- **Glucose;**\r\n- **Glucose Solids;**\r\n- **Golden Sugar;**\r\n- **Golden Syrup;**\r\n- **Granulated Sugar;**\r\n- **Grape Juice Concentrate;**\r\n- **Grape Sugar;**\r\n- **High-Fructose Corn Syrup;**\r\n- **Honey;**\r\n- **Icing Sugar;**\r\n- **Invert Sugar;**\r\n- **Lactose;**\r\n- **Malt Syrup;**\r\n- **Maltodextrin;**\r\n- **Maltose;**\r\n- **Mannitol;**\r\n- **Maple Syrup;**\r\n- **Molasses;**\r\n- **Muscovado Syrup;**\r\n- **Organic Raw Sugar;**\r\n- **Powdered Sugar;**\r\n- **Raw Sugar;**\r\n- **Refiners' Syrup;**\r\n- **Rice Syrup;**\r\n- **Sorbitol;**\r\n- **Sorghum Syrup;**\r\n- **Sucrose;**\r\n- **Table Sugar;**\r\n- **Treacle;**\r\n- **Turbinado Sugar;**\r\n- **Yellow Sugar.**\r\n\r\n## Artificial sweeteners names\r\n- **Acesulfame K;**\r\n- **Aspartame;**\r\n- **Erythritol;**\r\n- **Saccharin;**\r\n- **Sorbitol;**\r\n- **Sucralose;**\r\n- **Stevia;**\r\n- **Xylitol.**\r\n\r\n## What are the substitutes?\r\nThe best substitute for a sweet tooth is undoubtedly **fresh fruit**.\r\n\r\nBut let's get real, we cannot deprive ourselves completely from sugars. The important thing is to identify the sources with high amounts and eliminate them. Probably the **worst sugar and sweetener sources are beverages**, and those should be substituted with water.\r\n\r\nIf you are sedentary and have metabolic issues, you should quit sugar and sweetener consumption altogether. Otherwise, a tablespoon of **raw honey** a day should be enough; honey is also extremely honey in small daily amounts. The safest sweetener out there is **stevia**, which is safe in small amounts (one teaspoon per day).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, **start small**. Eliminate sugar in baby steps not entirely from the beginning.\r\n\r\n# Plant seed oils\r\nThe cases of hypertension, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, strokes, etc. have increased drastically since the substitution of animal fat with plant seed oils and margarine.\r\n\r\nThe real reason why plant seed oils are dangerous is that they contain high amounts of **polyunsaturated fats**. These kind of fats are **extremely unstable** and become rancid almost immediately after packaging.\r\n\r\nMost plant seed oils are **partially hydrogenated** to extend shelf life, which makes them more harmful as they now contain **trans fat**. Margarine is almost entirely trans fat.\r\n\r\nTrans and polyunsaturated fats (omega-6s) are **incredibly inflammatory** and **raise LDL (bad) cholesterol** while **lowering HDL (good) cholesterol**. They are present in almost every **processed and packaged foods**. Not to mention fast-foods.\r\n\r\n## Health problems:\r\n\r\n- **Heart disease;**\r\n- **Cardiovascular disease;**\r\n- **Type 2 diabetes;**\r\n- **Fat\u002FWeight gain (Obesity);**\r\n- **Metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes;**\r\n- **Dysbiosis (e.g., IBS, IBD);**\r\n- **Joint problems (e.g., Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis);**\r\n- **Macular degeneration (Eye damage);**\r\n- **Brain problems (e.g., Depression, Memory\u002FAlzheimer's, Anxiety, ADD\u002FADHD);**\r\n- **Asthma;**\r\n- **Cancer;**\r\n- **Infertility;**\r\n- **Psychiatric disorders;**\r\n- **Autoimmune disease.**\r\n\r\n## Plant seed oils\r\n\r\n- **Canola oil;**\r\n- **Flaxseed oil;**\r\n- **Sunflower oil;**\r\n- **Safflower oil;**\r\n- **Corn oil;**\r\n- **Hemp seed oil;**\r\n- **Corn oil;**\r\n- **Walnut oil;**\r\n- **Peanut oil;**\r\n- **Cottonseed oil;**\r\n- **Soybean oil.**\r\n\r\nGenerally, if it is extracted from a plant nut, seed, bean, or grain, avoid it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the substitutes?\r\n\r\n- **Extra-virgin, cold-pressed olive oil**;\r\n- **Cold-pressed coconut oil\u002Fbutter** (extra-virgin has coconut taste);\r\n- **Pasteur raised animal fats** (e.g., **Butter, Ghee, Lard, Tallow**).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n- Limit (or stay away if possible) added sugars and artificial sweeteners;\r\n- 1 tbsp. of raw honey or 1 tsp. of stevia per day is excellent;\r\n- Stay away from nut, seed, bean, or grain oils;\r\n- Use animal fats and coconut oil for cooking and avocados and extra-virgin olive oil for salads.\r\n\r\n# Follow the white rabbit:\r\n\r\n- [The truth about sweeteners](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nhs.uk\u002Flive-well\u002Feat-well\u002Fare-sweeteners-safe\u002F);\r\n- [Sugar is Killing Us.
