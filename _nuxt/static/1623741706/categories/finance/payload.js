These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment. I am curious.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

He told me it was easy money.\r\n\r\n![Django Unchained Meme](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F781\u002F0*1kA9rJcHrolxKzHs)\r\n\r\nI heard about trading and the stock market years ago in movies like “Limitless” and the notorious “The Wolf of Wallstreet”, but never understood how they work.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to trade, I was wise enough to take some courses and get educated. I took the courses from  [XTB](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade\u002Ftrading-academy)  and got familiar with charts, patterns, and indicators.\r\n\r\nThus, I started trading in the demo account and made some profits, so I deposited money in a real account and started taking action. Everything went fine until I started losing money; lots of money.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why can’t I make easy money as others do? Fuck trading! It is all a scheme.” That was my attitude towards trading until I realized my mistakes and started making profits.\r\n\r\n**These lessons cost me $5000 plus $1000 lost in Bitcoin**, but I am sharing them with you for free, you lucky you. Ok, let’s see my mistakes.\r\n\r\n# Overexposed\r\n\r\nI  **traded with the money I was not comfortable with losing**. All my monthly savings were put into trading and it became like an addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter losing money I put money again with the hope I can compensate for my losses. Sound like gambling to me, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI was constantly checking the trading app, very stressed and panic when seeing everything in red. I didn’t know what I was doing. This leads us to my second mistake.\r\n\r\n# No strategy & research\r\n\r\nMy strategy was to make money, that’s it. I never implemented a backtested strategy for all 3 possible scenarios of a trend (up, down, sideways). If the candle was green buy; otherwise sell. Cool right?\r\n\r\nWell, lucky for you I have a good article on a simple, yet a profitable backtested strategy that you can apply on any market.\r\n\r\nBefore trading or investing, have a plan and make sure you understand what you are putting your money into.  **Technical analysis (trading) without fundamental analysis is bullshit**  in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple and I will give you Bitcoin as an example. All the charts and indicators indicate strong buy, but the bull market cycle is over or Elon Musk makes another tweet. The indicators are useless in this case.\r\n\r\nAnother example is buying Tesla just because the trend is going up and the oscillators say not overbought, but not considering the P\u002FE ratio of 800 (extremely overpriced).\r\n\r\n# Not diversified enough\r\n\r\nYou know that saying:  **“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”**. I didn’t know that and put too much money into a single deal which was also not a well-researched deal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb for diversification, but you can for sure over diversify. The main idea is to  **choose different markets**  (stocks, commodities, real estate, crypto, etc.) and  **buy different assets.**\r\n\r\nNow, the way I do it is by looking at the cycles and fundamental indicators. For instance, I am more invested in crypto and commodities, than stocks and real estate.\r\n\r\nThis is because I know hyperinflation is coming, I know we are in a crypto bull market, and I know real estate and stocks are overpriced. Again, I am not just a trader, but also an investor (technical & fundamental analysis).\r\n\r\nAlso, in crypto, I choose only the best from the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, and not buying tens of crypto assets. I did that and it is a wrong approach.\r\n\r\nOk, hope everything makes sense. Let’ move to the next big mistake I made.\r\n\r\n# Over-leveraged\r\n\r\nI used  [leverage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fl\u002Fleverage.asp)  without understanding it fully. The problem with leverage is that in case the market moves in the opposite direction, you are at risk of liquidation. Not only that but not using a stop loss… haha… awful shit can happen as it did to me.\r\n\r\nLeverage is the reason I lost so much money (for me, an average mortal).  **Leverage amplified my lack of knowledge, strategy, experience, and diversification.**\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what leverage is, let me explain it simply like this:  **your investment (or %price move) multiplied by a ratio**. In other words, if a market has a leverage of 1:2 (2x), that means you are doubling the price change.\r\n\r\nIf the price goes up 5%, the leverage amplifies and you are winning a 10%. Same story if the price goes down. You are borrowing money for investing. $100 invested in a 1:2 leveraged asset, is equal to $200 invested.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is, if you are a beginner or don’t understand how to use leverage, do not ever use it. The risk is not worth it.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nThe last mistake, but not the least is I let my emotions control my trading and investing decisions. Of course, no strategy, over-invested, not diversified, leverage, all these amplified my emotions.\r\n\r\n**Investing and trading must be 100% analytical**; with no emotions and gut feelings. If you can automate your trading strategy, it is awesome. Otherwise, know your plan and stick to it no matter what.\r\n\r\nRemember that  **no indicator, strategy, analysis, whatever are 100% guaranteed**  to offer you profits. It is a delusion most beginners like me had.\r\n\r\nWe are working with probabilities, and the idea is to increase the likelihood of ending up in profit.\r\n\r\n\u003E A backtested strategy, with the right amount of investment, with enough diversification, without the risk of being liquidated, with patience, and no emotions will make you an unstoppable investor and trader.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

We moved from greed to extreme fear in a month.  **The big issue is uncertainty: is the bull market over or not?**  What we know for sure is that we are in a dump.\r\n\r\nI may be a masochist, but this big dump was necessary. There were too many gamblers in the crypto space putting their money into shit coins that could go to the moon.\r\n\r\nNot to mention extremely greedy people who use high leverage or put all their money into coins without good fundamentals or without researching.\r\n\r\n\u003E “Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.” — Warren Buffet\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have been studying crypto and investing for only a year now. Until then, I have been also a gambler since 2017 in crypto and forex and I lost a lot of money. I was ready to quit, but then I decided to invest in learning.\r\n\r\nI am still in profit, which is fortunate, but I guarantee more than half the crypto “investors” are in a big loss. However, 75% of the crypto investors who are still holding are under stress, myself included.\r\n\r\nBefore we entered the crypto space, we needed to be prepared for this. I hope you didn’t think that crypto just goes up 10x and that is that — I was hoping it would; me like money.\r\n\r\nIf you are extremely stressed like me, it is because of these reasons.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose\r\n\r\nI put all my saved money into crypto. How greedy of me, right? A month ago I sold some profits into USDT and almost had all my initial investment cashed out.\r\n\r\nHowever, the dark devil from the left of my shoulder told me: “Look how everything goes up, don’t you want some more short-term profits? Don’t be a fool and buy, what can go wrong?”. Everything!\r\n\r\nI re-invested and now I regret it. I bought more than I was ready to lose, because of greed. Now, I deserve my well-learned lesson.\r\n\r\nThe money invested is also the money I need for a new well-needed car, which I should buy in a month. This brings us to our second lesson.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest the money you need in the next 3 months\r\n\r\nCorrections happen every month around the 15th day and they may last for 2 months just to recover. If you invested a few days or weeks before this correction, you need to wait 3 months just to not be at a loss or in a small profit.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in cycles based on Bitcoin’s 4-year halving. When you invest in crypto, plan to hold for 4 years and there is a very high possibility you will be in profit.\r\n\r\n# Don’t check your portfolio every hour\r\n\r\nI repeat, crypto is highly volatile and you may see a 10% increase in an hour, and afterward a 10% decrease, or vice versa. It is also a waste of time and energy.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a swing trader, you should check your portfolio maximum at every 12 hours (2 times per day).\r\n\r\n# Have a plan\r\n\r\nAlways invest or trade with a plan. It doesn’t matter which market you choose, you always need to have a plan if you want to make profits.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a plan, you’re not an investor, nor a trader, but a gambler.\r\n\r\nI am a combination of investor and trader. I use fundamental analysis to choose a good asset but also use technical analysis to know when to enter and exit.\r\n\r\nMy mistake is that I didn’t exit Bitcoin a month ago when the  [indicators](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fpi-cycle-top-indicator\u002F) told me I should. Bitcoin kept going down and it is a matter of days or weeks until the entire crypto market follows it.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is the leader, where Bitcoin goes, crypto floes (sooner or later). There are also  [seasons](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F): Bitcoin season, altcoin season, major correction, repeat. Guess in which part we are now?\r\n\r\nI expect we are in half of the bull market and a big correction was necessary to mark this timestamp. The 200D MA supports Bitcoin, whereas the 50D MA supports the top altcoins\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F60\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1686\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D chart on TradingView\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the sell volume is decreasing and the RSI is less than 20.

He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down.

Come on!\r\n\r\nElon Musk is the man who created Paypal, sends rockets to Mars, and triggers the E.V. boom. He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though. A genius like him must have a plan. Or he may just like having fun with his influence.\r\n\r\n\u003E With great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the lessons from this experience are:\r\n\r\n-   listen to influencers with a grain of salt;\r\n-   crypto is prone to (psychological) manipulation, which makes it far from adoptable.\r\n\r\n# Bear market already?\r\n\r\nIf we go below the 200-day EMA, most probably.

Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
