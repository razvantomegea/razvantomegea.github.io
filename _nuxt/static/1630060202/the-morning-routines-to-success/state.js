It sets our momentum for the rest of the day, so how we manage is crucial. We can set ourselves off either for success, either for failure.\r\n\r\n# Checking the news (do not)\r\nThe worst thing to do first thing in the morning is checking our phone or pc as it will sabotage our entire day. But why?\r\nChelsea Pottenger, a wellbeing expert, and consultant at EQ Consulting, in a [study](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.google.com\u002Famp\u002Fs\u002Famp.whimn.com.au\u002Fstrength\u002Fhealth\u002Fthe-major-risks-of-checking-your-phone-first-thing-in-the-mornings\u002Fnews-story\u002F93e51aed44e5d475309c44f894a20d5f), concluded that:\r\n\r\n\u003E\"When we first wake up, we transition from a delta brainwave of sleep into a theta brain wave - where the brain is more flexible and malleable. The theta brainwave is vital to becoming more emotionally intelligent individuals, creative and adept at problem-solving.\"\r\n\r\nThe act of checking our emails, the news or the social media feed, we are substituting the important theta brain wave with the beta brainwave of high stress.\r\nThis has a significant impact on the physical structure of the brain, on our ability to perform, and our general wellness.\r\n\r\n# Set goals (do)\r\nInstead of acting as a receiver and receiving information from the outside world we should act as senders and send our intentions to the Universe and set our goals for the day as clearly as possible.\r\nThis is uncomfortable at the beginning, almost impossible even, but there is a morning routine that will give you the boost for success\r\n\r\n\r\n# Make your bed (definitely, do)\r\nThe simple act of making your bed will give you the mindset of accomplishment and discipline. You achieved your first goal for the day and now you're warmed up for the rest of them.\r\nBelieve it or not, few people make their bed first thing in the morning and all of those who do, are successful. It is a pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nin the morning, our brain is most malleable and flexible (vulnerable to wrong information);\r\navoid the news, social media, emails, and any information first 30 minutes in the morning;\r\nmake your bed and set goals first thing in the morning to have a successful day.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [The \"1 Billion Dollar Morning Routine\" - Habits of the World’s Most Successful People](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FSELWtQpcy1A)\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\r\n";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1630060202",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fthe-morning-routines-to-success",config:{}}}(false,"Self-development","The Morning Routines To Success",{},Array(1)));
