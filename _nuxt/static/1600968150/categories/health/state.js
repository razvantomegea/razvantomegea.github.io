My goal is not to be as big as possible. Muscles grow very slow if you have been training for a long time and don't have rare genetics. Thus, I choose to look fit like an athlete at the expense of not looking so big.\r\n\r\n# Strength training 3x per week\r\n\r\nI do a full-body strength training three times per week. You may think this is for beginners, but it is not. The legendary bodybuilder Reg Park and Steve Reeves (and other old-school bodybuilders) were fans of this style of training. They were big, lean, and natural.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI did for a while upper-lower slipt and push-pull-legs split, but this is the one I enjoy doing the most. **When I do multiple exercises per muscle group in a single session, I feel I can't push at the maximum at each muscle group exercise.** It makes sense if you train as hard as you can at the first exercise, you then exhaust the muscle and won't give it your all at the following.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy legs are the biggest victims. After I do heavy squats or Bulgarian split squats, I can't walk; my legs are shaking. I would be exhausted if I were to do 2-3 leg exercises in one session.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI think if you train correctly and intensely, you need less time in the gym. The muscle needs stimulus to grow, not destruction. Your **muscles don't grow in the gym, but during recovery**, if you provide them all nutrients.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnother important point I want to make is I focus on **compound movements, using only bodyweight, free weight, and pulley** based exercises. I feel they engage me the most and have a functional implication on the body.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at my workouts, shall we?\r\n\r\n## Workout #1 Monday:\r\n\r\n-   Bench press;\r\n-   Weighed pull-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Arnold press;\r\n-   Lying triceps extensions;\r\n-   E-Z Bar barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #2 Wednesday:\r\n\r\n-   Incline dumbbell press;\r\n-   Barbell rows;\r\n-   Military press;\r\n-   Rope triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Dumbbell curls;\r\n-   Bulgarian split squats;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #3 Friday:\r\n\r\n-   Weighed dips;\r\n-   Weighed chin-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Lateral raises + rear delts superset;\r\n-   Triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the big muscle group exercises, I do **one warm-up set of 10-15 reps, and four working sets of 3-6 reps with the same weight**. When I can do six reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the small muscle group exercises, I do **four working sets of 5-8 reps**. When I can do eight reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne important note: I have **2-minute breaks between sets**, I **don't cheat**, and I **focus**  **on slow eccentric (negative)**. I do a 1-2 second concentric, 1-second isometric, and 3-4 second eccentric. The negative movement of the exercise has a higher impact on muscle growth than the positive one (check out [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.marksdailyapple.com\u002Fwhy-you-should-lift-and-lower-heavy-things\u002F)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, my workout routine allows me to recover between sessions. **When doing a high-intensity workout, your muscles are not the only ones exhausted, but your nervous system as well**. The nervous system doesn't have time to recover if one is doing a heavy high-intensity workout on consecutive days.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't do direct exercise on calves, forearms, and traps because they are worked indirectly by the compound movements.\r\n\r\n# Walking\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the days, I like to take long walks. Walking has no demand on the nervous system and even **helps with recovery**; not to mention that it **burns a lot of calories**. If you walk 12km, which is about 15.000 steps, you burn 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about walking is that you can do it anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I do full-body workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday;\r\n-   I do only compound movements;\r\n-   I do five sets for the big muscle group exercises, and four sets for the small ones;\r\n-   I focus on slow negatives (3-4 seconds) and correct form;\r\n-   I take 2-minute breaks between sets;\r\n-   I take long walks (12-15km) in the days off.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Yes, because being 100% healthy and 100% fit is not achievable for me at the same time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; there is garbage food everywhere. Everything is polluted and filled with chemicals and preservatives.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of so-called health foods that are calorie-dense (high calories per 100g). Let's see some common ones.\r\n\r\n# Cheese\r\n\r\nEverybody loves cheese, even people with lactose intolerance. I love cheese, but we need to learn to love what is good for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are many kinds of cheese, and I am not talking about low-fat cottage cheese, a great low-calorie, high-protein food. I am talking about the full-fat cheese, like cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick, and other matured high fat cheese.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey are very healthy and delicious, as they contain beneficial bacteria (if from trusted sources). The issue is they have **300-400 kcal per 100g. It is a lot of calories**, compared to low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, which contain 70-80 kcal per 100g.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I can never eat 50-100g of whole cheese. I eat 200-300g, which is 1000kcal. Thus, I avoid it and stick to low-fat dairy.\r\n\r\n# Coconut oil\r\n\r\nI used to put coconut oil in almost anything for its miracle benefits. They say it contains a lot of MCT oil, which is used directly for energy and not stored as fat. I was a fool to believe it. Any oil is stored as fat if it leads to a daily calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, coconut oil is a better alternative to plant-seed oils as it doesn't oxidize so quickly and easily. However, you still need to pay attention to the quantities, as it is **900kcal per 100g** (100% fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRegardless if you're using coconut oil or any oil, use a spray. I spray my pan when frying anything. Don't just pour from the bottle. If you don't have a cooking spray, use a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n# Peanut\u002FAlmond\u002FCashew butter\r\n\r\nI was addicted to peanut butter, and since the day I quit eating it, I started losing fat without thinking about it. **Peanut butter has, indeed, 26g of protein per 100g and lots of minerals, but it comes with a price of 550 kcal - if 100% peanuts**. There are kinds of peanut butter with only 50% peanuts, and the rest is palm oil. Those may reach 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found that a better version of peanut butter is powdered peanut butter, which is half the calories and doubles the protein.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI quit consuming peanuts completely, however, because I noticed I have smelly gas after, and I think I don't tolerate them (the irony).\r\n\r\n# Nuts and Seeds\r\n\r\nYou know what they say, eat vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds for a healthy diet. I agree only with 40% of this recommendation. The only healthy foods on this planet that anyone can agree with are vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGrains, nuts, and seeds are **high in calories and high in antinutrients** (prevent nutrient absorption.)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like to drink beer and eat nuts and seeds along the side, no wonder you have a big belly. **Nuts and seeds have ~650kcal per 100g**. 100g of nuts and seeds is less than a handful.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to snack something when watching a movie or when socializing, **choose home-made (not microwaved) popcorn or popcorn without added fat**. It has only 350kcal per 100g, but 100g is a lot.\r\n\r\n# Granola and Muesli\r\n\r\nMy journey to eating healthy begun with eating muesli, which is cereal combined with dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. If you also add some milk, you can have 1000kcal in a single meal. Now, if I think about it, granola is not that healthy, as it may contain a lot of sugar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy breakfast on muesli and milk had 1500kcal and didn't keep me so full, as it is mainly carbs and sugar. When we eat a **meal high in carbs and sugar (and fat), with low fiber and protein, we get an insulin spike and then a crash** (like Bitcoin in 2017). After the crash, we are hungry again.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Grains (pasta is from grains), dried fruits, sugar, and honey usually have 350kcal per 100g**. If you add the nuts and seeds, 100g granola (or muesli) can have 450 kcal per 100g, with minimal protein and fiber.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA better option is oatmeal with fruits and low fat cottage cheese or yogurt. Oatmeal, like bread, popcorn, or rice cakes, is expanded cereal, which adds more volume and fewer calories (~35% fewer calories.)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   choose low-fat foods if losing body fat is your goal;\r\n-   use oil and butter carefully, with a spray or teaspoon;\r\n-   avoid nuts and seeds;\r\n-   choose expanded grains (bread, popcorn, oatmeal, rice cakes) instead of ready to eat grains (granola, muesli, cornflakes, .etc.).\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

This article and blog are purely educational and informational._\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live dark times, that's for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntil the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.\r\n\r\n# Fresh air\r\n\r\nWe need fresh air to purify ourselves. **We live most of our lives in boxes**: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe some of you don't have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, **open the damn windows** and let the air come in. Don't incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStaying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day**. If I don't, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.\r\n\r\n# Vitamin D3\r\n\r\nAnother reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don't get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVitamin d3 is **essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin** (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don't agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check [Dr. Mercola's website](https:\u002F\u002Fvitamind.mercola.com\u002F).\r\n\r\n# (Less) Hygiene\r\n\r\nDisinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That's what they keep on saying everywhere we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHippocrates said: \"Everything in excess is opposed to nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is also a saying: \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExcess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they **disrupt our microbiome.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria** within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, **antibacterial does not mean antiviral**, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, our **microbiome is essential in developing antibodies**. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is enough to **use regular soap** to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check [this](https:\u002F\u002Fen.unesco.org\u002Fnews\u002Fhow-soap-kills-covid-19-hands) and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.uchealth.org\u002Ftoday\u002Fwhy-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus\u002F)). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYour body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you're tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.\r\n\r\n# Healthy food\r\n\r\nWe are what we eat, that's for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won't grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you make your diet based on **vegetables and fruits**. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you're not vegan or vegetarian, **lean meats** are great. If you tolerate **eggs and fish,** Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nSleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExercise **increases blood flow and oxygenation**, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.\r\n\r\n# Stress management\r\n\r\n(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because **chronic stress lowers our immune system**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFind ways to relax as much as you can. For me, **exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep** do miracles.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nForce yourself to **smile and be optimistic**. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n# Cold showers\r\n\r\nI have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. **I feel warm all the time** because my circulation is improved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. **Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.\r\n\r\n# Medicinal mushrooms\r\n\r\nNo, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest **medicinal mushrooms may** [**improve immunity**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002F31520706\u002F)**, may have** [**antioxidant properties**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubag.nal.usda.gov\u002Fcatalog\u002F6995766) **and may** [**fight cancer**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002F32504783\u002F)**.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe most popular medicinal mushroom is **Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)**. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.\r\n\r\n# Turmeric and Ginger\r\n\r\nTurmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nccih.nih.gov\u002Fhealth\u002Fginger), and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nccih.nih.gov\u002Fhealth\u002Fturmeric)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGinger and turmeric may have **anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**, which in turn boost the immune system. Again, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any herb and supplement.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

After I do some work, I prepare my first main meal, usually around 11:00 a.m. The **whey protein shake, creatine, greens powder, vitamin D3, medicinal mushrooms (for immunity) are the only supplements I take.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy first main meal is usually an **omelet** (five eggs and six egg whites), two cans of **grilled mackerel in water**, three slices of **toast bread**, some **tomatoes**, some **red peppers**, some **greek yogurt**, some **fruit**, and some **green tea**. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe second meal is usually around 5:00 p.m., and I will have **some lean meat with vegetables**. It can be grilled **chicken breast**, baked **sweet potatoes**, and some **salad** in some days. On other days, it can be some grilled **beef** with **potatoes** and salad. Sometimes I will make a **stew** with lots of vegetables and lean meat. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter this meal, I will eat some **fruit**, depending on the season. It can be watermelon, peaches, nectarines, blackberries, apples, cherries, clementines, etc. This snack is around 300kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like consistency. **I enjoy eating the same foods**, my favorite foods, over and over again. It requires less mental energy. I never have cheat meals because I don't need them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are days and periods I am away from home, or I hang out with my friends, girlfriend, or (and) family. When this happens, I focus on my favorite food groups: vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. If these are not present, I eat small portions of something similar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI drink alcohol on occasions, but only when I have a day off from everything the next day, usually on Saturday or Friday. When I drink, I choose low-calorie drinks, like wine, cognac, or \"rachiu\" (a beverage from Romania similar to tequila, but better).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI try to avoid, when not at home, fried foods, fatty foods, and deserts. These are high in calories, low in volume, and highly palatable. They make me eat them without stopping.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy strategy is to **eat foods high in volume, rich in water, fiber, and protein, and low in calories**. It is the reason why I eat vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. These foods fill me up with the least amount of calories. They also offer me all the essential nutrients I need: amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't keep in my house trigger foods, foods that I like so much that I cannot stop eating them after I begin. For me, these foods are peanut butter and coconut, or foods containing them. I like them so much that I cannot stop myself at a bite.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be as lean as possible. Of course, I want to increase my muscle mass as well, but I don't think I have the genetics to be a monster. To achieve my goal, I stay in a constant calorie deficit or maintenance at a maximum and eat sufficient protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My daily requirements are ~3000kcal, and I eat ~2500kcal.** Some days I burn less and eat less. It depends. I also aim to consume **200g protein per day,** to build and preserve my muscle mass, and 100g fats. I don't care how much carbs I consume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **eat only foods you enjoy and avoid trigger foods, but make sure they are high in volume and low in calories.**\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nI love walking. I **walk everyday 6-15km**. During these sessions, I burn 350-900kcal. It is an exercise I can do regardless of the weather, with any equipment, anywhere, any time. It also helps me relax, makes me feel better, and sleep better.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am also a fan of strength training. **I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and train all the muscle groups in one session**. For a while, I went to the gym six days per week, using the push-pull-legs split, but it was too exhausting, and I didn't have the Saturday off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe full-body training split ensures I equally train all the muscle groups, and I have a rest day between sessions for my muscles and nervous system to recover. I also have the weekends off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **do the exercises you enjoy and which you can stick to** regardless of external circumstances.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is so underrated these days. We cannot make wise decisions and function at our full potential without good quality sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sleep, it is not much to say. I **fall asleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 08:00 a.m.** every day. Sometimes, on weekends, I go to bed later and wake up later, but not every weekend. Whenever I can, I stick to my sleeping schedule, and I aim **towards 8-9 hours of sleep per night.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have some habits before bed, though. **After 10:30 p.m. (1 hour before sleep), all lights are turned off** and avoid them. Artificial lights make me alert and disrupt my melatonin (sleep hormone) levels. Maybe it happens to you too. I also **keep the room dark as a cave and not too warm.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn my phone and laptop, I use the Iris app to filter out blue light, which hurts my eyes and disrupts my sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed that chamomile tea before bed helps me sleep a lot better, so I drink 2-4 cups before bed. When I don't have tea, I take a sleep supplement with valerian root, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d3, and melatonin. I don't recommend any supplements to anyone; I am just informing what I do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours** so that the body sets its circadian rhythm. Also, avoid any form of artificial light 1 hour before bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat is all my friends. The big lesson you need to take from this article is to **create a routine for life that you enjoy.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I eat foods high in volume and low in calories (vegetables, fruit, and lean meats), that I enjoy, and avoid foods that I can't stop eating;\r\n-   I walk every day and train my entire body three times per week;\r\n-   I go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours, and avoid artificial light one hour before bed;\r\n-   one day per week, I don't stick to my routines and enjoy life with my loved ones.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

So many opinions and so much confusion. If you are reading this, I guess you are struggling with getting lean and staying lean.\r\n\r\nI've been fluctuating with my weight and body composition throughout my life in a visible manner. I've been experimenting with some diets and eating patterns, and I've found that only one trick worked. It's not just me, but the majority of people. It's the **law of physics** that will never be broken.\r\n\r\nDoes it require discipline? Yes! Is it simple? Yes! Is it easy? In the beginning, not at all. In the beginning, nothing is easy, but if you want to be lean, then you will do it.\r\n\r\n# Calorie deficit\r\n\r\nThe calorie deficit is the holy grail of body composition. Body fat, adipose tissue, is stored energy. Energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, just transformed.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with calories, **calories are a unit of measurement for energy**. Our bodies require energy to function every day. We use energy when we think, when we digest, when our heart pumps blood, when our organs do their jobs. Nothing can be achieved without energy.\r\n\r\nWe get the **energy from the food we consume**. Every food has some energy. If it's packaged, the food has a label and you can see some nutrition facts on the label. The first one, bolded is energy.\r\n\r\n**If we ingest more energy than we burn, that energy will be stored in our body somewhere, so we will gain weight**. If we burn more than we ingest, that energy will be released and used. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion.\r\n\r\n# How many calories do we need?\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's pretty hard, nearly **impossible to estimate 100% accurately how much we ingest and burn** throughout that day. This is why so many people say calorie counting is useless. It is not useless. Don't be discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily about tracking 100% accurate. It is more about **being mindful of everything you put in your mouth**. Trust me, you can lose fat without moving a finger if you're tracing your calories properly.\r\n\r\nYou just need to be approximately around your calorie goals. In the last 7 years, the only thing that worked for me to be lean and stay lean is calorie count and being in a calorie deficit. Ask any professional fitness coach or nutritionist and they will tell you the same.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have some metabolic or hormonal disorder. In these cases, your metabolism is in chaos, and may be hard to estimate your resting metabolic rate. If this is the case, you'll have to experiment with some daily calories on a weekly basis and see how your body changes and then adjust from there. The calorie equation still applies.\r\n\r\nI recommend you **use an app** to do this job, otherwise, it is overkill. You can use my app, [https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F). You can track your body composition, diet, and exercise habits. It will do all the calculations for you.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing you need is to **calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR)**. This is the energy your body consumes when your sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, it is around 2000 kcal per day. This is why the professionals set 2000kcal as the average daily caloric requirements. It is not correct though. We are not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to **track your eating habits**. Everything that you eat and has calories, track it.\r\n\r\nLastly, track your **physical activities**. From housework to intense workouts.\r\n\r\nThe energy balance equation is this: **food - resting metabolic rate - physical activities**. Again, my application will do this for you.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lose fat, the energy balance equation must be **slightly less than 0 (max -10% of required)**. If you want to gain some healthy weight, the energy balance equation must be **slightly more than 0 (max +10% of required)**. For maintenance, **around 0**  **(+\u002F-3% of required)**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   you need to track your calories if you want to change your body composition;\r\n-   if you want to lose fat, you need to be in a slight calorie deficit (10%);\r\n-   if you want to gain healthy weight, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus (10%);\r\n-   if you want to maintain, you need to be in calorie maintenance.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.\r\n\r\n-   the economy is about to crash;\r\n-   people die and are sick all around the planet;\r\n-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;\r\n-   some of us are unemployed;\r\n-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.\r\n\r\n# 1. Health is the most critical asset\r\n\r\nI learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.\r\n\r\nIt is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.\r\n\r\nTake care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**\r\n\r\nWe are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. \r\n\r\nAll I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.\r\n\r\nOur immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.\r\n\r\nYou see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:\r\n\r\n-   avoid closed and public areas;\r\n-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;\r\n-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;\r\n-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;\r\n-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);\r\n-   limit alcohol and smoking;\r\n-   eat real food and limit processed food;\r\n-   drink plenty of water;\r\n-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);\r\n-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;\r\n-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.\r\n\r\n# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it\r\n\r\nThere was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.\r\n\r\n**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**\r\n\r\nMy advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.\r\n\r\n# 3. Be prepared for anything\r\n\r\nI am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.\r\n\r\n-   I invested in a minimal home gym;\r\n-   I take cold showers;\r\n-   I spend most time alone;\r\n-   I work remotely;\r\n-   I cook and prepare my food;\r\n-   I live a healthy lifestyle;\r\n-   I don't depend on my parents.\r\n\r\nI am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.\r\n\r\nLife is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.\r\n\r\n# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.\r\n\r\nWe need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.\r\n\r\nYou may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.\r\n\r\n**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**\r\n\r\nLife will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\n**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.\r\n\r\nNow, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.\r\n\r\n**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**\r\n\r\n# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true\r\n\r\nEverybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.\r\n\r\n**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**\r\n\r\nJust ask, \"why?\". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.\r\n\r\n**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.\r\n\r\nReporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.\r\n\r\n**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

However, if your motivation is the latter, we have a problem.\r\n\r\nJust because something works for one or more individuals, doesn't mean it will work for you. We are unique to the biochemical and genetic level. We need to find out what is right for us through experimentation regardless of what others say and do.\r\n\r\nEven if your goal is longevity, vitality, or performance, veganism may not be optimal for you. Fat burning is all a matter of overall caloric and hormonal balance. Veganism may make you store more fat. The only valid goals for veganism are spiritual and environmental protection. Otherwise, try it temporarily and listen to your body.\r\n\r\n# Human Evolution\r\n\r\nMany vegans claim that humans are not meant to eat food from animal sources. We are plant consumers through nature. Are we now?\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at our predecessors, the primates. Are they vegan? Of course not. They indeed eat plants (fruits, leaves, roots) primarily, but also eat insects, birds, and eggs when plants are not available (off-season). Before agriculture, we have been hunter-gatherers for millions of years and fed from plants in season and animals off-season. We are omnivores.\r\n\r\n# Is it for you?\r\n\r\nIgnore when people say that we are meant to be vegans or veganism is better than other diets. You are not the same as other people and are not necessarily intended to be vegan.\r\n\r\nThe only way to know if it is right for you is to give it a shot for a few weeks and see how your body responds. If you feel better as the days go by, then kudos to you. Otherwise, don't force yourself dogmatically. Always listen to your body because it knows what is best for it.

Nutrition is a science. **Nutrition is the science of how food components (nutrients) transform and interact within our bodies**. Thus, our focus is on what those food components nutrients are and what they do.\r\n\r\n# Nutrients\r\n\r\nOur body requires the nutrient compounds present in food. The more nutrient-dense food is, the higher it's quality.\r\n\r\n## Macronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Carbohydrates;\r\n-   Proteins;\r\n-   Lipids;\r\n-   Water.\r\n\r\n## Micronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Vitamins;\r\n-   Minerals.\r\n\r\nWe should no longer see food as just belly-filling, hunger inhibiting substance. Food should be cellular nourishment.\r\n\r\n## Essential nutrients\r\n\r\nNow, upon these nutrients, not all of them are essential. Some of them can be produced internally by the body (non-essential). Our focus should be mostly on the essential nutrients.\r\n\r\n-   **Water**;\r\n-   **Major Minerals** (Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium);\r\n-   **Trace Minerals** (Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine);\r\n-   **Amino Acids** (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine);\r\n-   **Fatty Acids** (Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid);\r\n-   **Vitamins** (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic acid, Cobalamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Choline).\r\n\r\nIn the next articles, we'll focus on each nutrient group.

In this article, I will try to make you understand how human beings are meant to live and eliminate all possible confusions that dogmas have brought upon us.\r\n\r\nLet's forget everything we know for a second and have an overall picture of who and what we are.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we are mammals, and for millions of years, we have been living in the wild. In the last centuries, we have been more disconnected from our true nature than ever: living indoors, moving insufficiently, eating factory food products, sleeping out of sync and poorly, living inside our heads (overthinking\u002Foverstressing).\r\n\r\nAll other living beings except humans live in nature where they were destined to live. **Nature separation is where we have gone wrong.**\r\n\r\nIf we are meant to live in nature, we have to accept whatever and whenever nature has to offer.\r\n\r\nBut do we need?\r\n\r\n# Food\r\nWe need natural food. Food that is found almost ready to eat in nature and unaltered by man. We also need to keep in mind seasons and climate.\r\n\r\nWe are not herbivores, like elephants or giraffes, because we don't have big multi-chamber stomachs. We are also not carnivores (predators), because we don't have huge claws and teeth like tigers. We are something in between - **hunter-gatherers.**\r\n\r\nWe need to eat fresh vegetables and fruits (and some nuts and seeds from the shell) in seasons. The rest of the time, we need to hunt wild animals.\r\n\r\nWe also don't eat to eat all the time, because food may not be available all the time. Thus, **intermittent-fasting** may be in order as it is a natural thing to do, especially for consuming our stored energy (body fat).\r\n\r\nPracticality: **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting.**\r\n\r\n# Water\r\nNaturally (in the wild), we would drink only fresh spring water; hence, we should try to find the most unaltered water out there. Compared to regular tap water, spring water contains lots of minerals, and it is slightly alkaline.\r\n\r\nOf course, springs are not at every step, but we can there is **spring bottled water** in the markets. Just keep your eyes open for scams. Many bottles of water contain tap water.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more guaranteed, you can buy a water filter. The best one is the **reverse osmosis filter**. Other filters may also be fine if you are not living in polluted cities like New York.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **drink fresh spring water or purified water.**\r\n\r\n# Movement\r\nHunter-gatherers hunt and gather, which means spending most of the day on foot walking and carrying heavy things. Also, we need to ensure shelter which mens some hard labor. In some critical cases, we may also need to run to save our lives from predators.\r\n\r\nWe are meant to do **low-impact physical activity most of the day, mainly walking, and high-impact physical activity from time to time**.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\nAs wild animals, our circadian rhythms have been guided by the sun, and still is. Unfortunately, electricity (artificial light) has been messing up with our biological clock, and we no longer get the good quality sleep we once had.\r\n\r\nYou see, **sleep quantity is not that important**. Really! Have you ever heard people telling you they slept 6 hours, but still feel refreshed? Or, on the other side, have you ever heard people sleeping for 12 hours and always be tired?\r\n\r\nThe reason is the sleep quality.  The better the quality, the better the effect of sleep has on our body, like healing and assimilation.\r\n\r\nHow to achieve good quality sleep? We need to try to simulate the environment we once had back when we lived in the wild.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **go to bed and wake up at the same hours** (ideally, by the sun)**, avoid light before sleep** (\u003E1 hour)**, and keep the bedroom dark and cool.**\r\n\r\n# Sunlight and Fresh Air\r\nThe only time we would spend inside would be during the night and bad weather. The rest of the time, wild humans would spend outside in the sunlight and fresh air. Nowadays, we spend most of our lives in boxes (houses, cars, buses, trains) which makes us deprived of fresh air and sunlight.\r\n\r\n**We need sunlight for vitamin D, which is a precursor for a lot of hormones.** We also need fresh air for oxygen, of course.\r\n\r\nNow, we live on a polluted planet, which is a big pitty, and we can hardly find fresh air. We don't need to be perfect, though, so **spending time in nature is enough.** \r\n\r\nPracticality: **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day.**\r\n\r\n# Relationships\r\nIf we look in nature, we see animal groups everywhere. Rarely animals live alone, including humans. **Humans are social beings**. We have evolved living in tribes and communities. We looked after one another, and this is what we should.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, technological evolution and its overuse have disconnected us from each other. Rarely we connect and spend good time with the people who matter. Social media is a major reason why depression and anxiety are on the rise.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch to this. You are better of living alone than with toxic people. I, for instance, spend most time alone, because I cannot find some people with whom I can resonate. I am happy, though. I feel free and limitless all the time.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **spend time with good quality people and avoid toxic people.**\r\n\r\n# Play\r\n\"Stop being a child! Grow up! Be serious!\" - They say.\r\n\r\nWe live in a serious world where being juvenile is a sin, especially making mistakes. This serious and super-fast world has made us forget to play and spend some regular leisure time.\r\n\r\nWe must be productive, right? Well, it seems that taking time to play and unwind can increase overall productivity.\r\n\r\nPlay can have any form, from playing a sport to spending time with the children or making a fool out of oneself. The idea is to **have fun and let the inner child come out**.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **have fun and enjoy life as often as possible**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting;**\r\n-   **drink fresh spring water or purified water;**\r\n-   **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training;\r\n-   **go to bed and wake up at the same hours** (ideally, by the sun)**, avoid light before sleep** (\u003E1 hour)**, and keep the bedroom dark and cool;**\r\n-   **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day;**\r\n-   **spend time with good quality people and avoid toxic people;**\r\n-   **have fun and enjoy life as often as possible**.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Just read the label, and you'll see.\r\n\r\nSugars and sweeteners are also in the kitchen of every living soul.\r\n\r\nRemember this, **if it is sweet or contains something ending in \"-ose\", it is\u002Fhas sugars**, regardless of being natural or artificial.\r\n\r\nSince the 19th century, we have been consuming sweeteners like water.

The important thing is to identify the sources with high amounts and eliminate them. Probably the **worst sugar and sweetener sources are beverages**, and those should be substituted with water.\r\n\r\nIf you are sedentary and have metabolic issues, you should quit sugar and sweetener consumption altogether. Otherwise, a tablespoon of **raw honey** a day should be enough; honey is also extremely honey in small daily amounts. The safest sweetener out there is **stevia**, which is safe in small amounts (one teaspoon per day).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, **start small**. Eliminate sugar in baby steps not entirely from the beginning.\r\n\r\n# Plant seed oils\r\nThe cases of hypertension, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, strokes, etc. have increased drastically since the substitution of animal fat with plant seed oils and margarine.\r\n\r\nThe real reason why plant seed oils are dangerous is that they contain high amounts of **polyunsaturated fats**. These kind of fats are **extremely unstable** and become rancid almost immediately after packaging.\r\n\r\nMost plant seed oils are **partially hydrogenated** to extend shelf life, which makes them more harmful as they now contain **trans fat**. Margarine is almost entirely trans fat.\r\n\r\nTrans and polyunsaturated fats (omega-6s) are **incredibly inflammatory** and **raise LDL (bad) cholesterol** while **lowering HDL (good) cholesterol**. They are present in almost every **processed and packaged foods**. Not to mention fast-foods.\r\n\r\n## Health problems:\r\n\r\n- **Heart disease;**\r\n- **Cardiovascular disease;**\r\n- **Type 2 diabetes;**\r\n- **Fat\u002FWeight gain (Obesity);**\r\n- **Metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes;**\r\n- **Dysbiosis (e.g., IBS, IBD);**\r\n- **Joint problems (e.g., Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis);**\r\n- **Macular degeneration (Eye damage);**\r\n- **Brain problems (e.g., Depression, Memory\u002FAlzheimer's, Anxiety, ADD\u002FADHD);**\r\n- **Asthma;**\r\n- **Cancer;**\r\n- **Infertility;**\r\n- **Psychiatric disorders;**\r\n- **Autoimmune disease.**\r\n\r\n## Plant seed oils\r\n\r\n- **Canola oil;**\r\n- **Flaxseed oil;**\r\n- **Sunflower oil;**\r\n- **Safflower oil;**\r\n- **Corn oil;**\r\n- **Hemp seed oil;**\r\n- **Corn oil;**\r\n- **Walnut oil;**\r\n- **Peanut oil;**\r\n- **Cottonseed oil;**\r\n- **Soybean oil.**\r\n\r\nGenerally, if it is extracted from a plant nut, seed, bean, or grain, avoid it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the substitutes?\r\n\r\n- **Extra-virgin, cold-pressed olive oil**;\r\n- **Cold-pressed coconut oil\u002Fbutter** (extra-virgin has coconut taste);\r\n- **Pasteur raised animal fats** (e.g., **Butter, Ghee, Lard, Tallow**).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n- Limit (or stay away if possible) added sugars and artificial sweeteners;\r\n- 1 tbsp. of raw honey or 1 tsp. of stevia per day is excellent;\r\n- Stay away from nut, seed, bean, or grain oils;\r\n- Use animal fats and coconut oil for cooking and avocados and extra-virgin olive oil for salads.\r\n\r\n# Follow the white rabbit:\r\n\r\n- [The truth about sweeteners](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nhs.uk\u002Flive-well\u002Feat-well\u002Fare-sweeteners-safe\u002F);\r\n- [Sugar is Killing Us.
