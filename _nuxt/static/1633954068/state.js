However, the process is not as easy as said. Some people obtain a caloric deficit naturally by feeling full very fast with few calories.\n\nI need a lot of food to feel satisfied (~1kg). Of course, I can try to eat slower, have smaller portions, eat more often, but that is not my thing. The truth is, **I love to eat a lot of food**.\n\nIf you feel me, you are probably like me. Fortunately, I managed to come with a recipe for staying fit while also eating a lot of food and not counting calories.\n\nThe recipe can be applied **anywhere, anytime, and for free**. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n### 1. Eliminate fat sources\n\n**Oil, butter, margarine, animal fat, nuts, seeds,** and anything containing them. In other words, (I) eat foods low in fat or without fat at all. The only **exception is fatty cold-water fish** which has the EPAs and DHAs (omega-3s).\n\nWe do not require that much fat because **our body is very good at producing fat on its own; the same story for sugars**.\n\nWe need to provide food high in essential nutrients: **water, protein** (some amino acids), **omega-3s** from cold-water fatty fish (omega-6s we have enough), **vitamins, minerals, and fiber** (a bit debatable).\n\nThus, foods high in water, protein, omega-3s, vitamins, minerals, and fiber are **vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products (+ fatty cold-water fish)**.\n\nOf course, you can also eat bread, rice, pasta, corn, or legumes on the side. You can also **enjoy once per week some pizza or something out of the rules**. I like to eat shawarma on Sundays and some cookies from time to time.\n\nYou should listen to your body if you have cravings, but do not overdo it. If you crave potato chips or french fries every day, we have a problem. You may not have cravings but bad habits.\n\n### 2. Don’t drink your calories\n\nThe next time you drink three beers or a Starbucks combo, think again. These two may be worth 500 kcalories, equivalent to a meal.\n\n**Beer, cocktails, soda, coffee with cream, energy drinks, fruit juices, and sugary drinks** must be avoided or kept only for one day per week.\n\nThe idea is simple: **fluid calories don’t make you full but make you crave them more**.\n\nI drink only **water, black coffee, non-calorie sweetened\u002Funsweetened tea, and low-calorie alcoholic drinks** (dry wine, tequila, brandy).\n\nIf you like sodas, substitute them with zero-calorie versions. They may not be healthier but will help you for sure keep away the fat.\n\n### 3. Walk as your life depends on it\n\nI walk **8000–15000 steps per day,** equivalent to 350–700kcal. **Walking is independent of weather, equipment, time, and location**. Your only excuse is comfort or a health condition (I am deeply sorry if that is the case).\n\nI wrote an article on walking which you can check [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4).\n\nAre you traveling? You can walk and visit. Are you working? You can go to work and back on foot. You can go shopping on foot when you don’t have too much to buy.\n\nYou can put some audiobooks or listen to podcasts while walking. It’s the most versatile exercise one can do. You also don’t need recovery from walking. If you’re in a hurry or want to boost the cardio benefits, you can increase the pace or elevation.\n\nThese are my three rules for staying lean without trying. I hope you found them useful, and I invite you to leave a comment with your tricks on how to stay lean."};g[1]={id:"can-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time",author:a,title:"Can You Really Build Muscle And Burn Fat At The Same Time?",createdOn:h,categories:b,description:"Is body recomposition real?",imageCredit:"Photo by Damir Spanic on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FCs73R4ZO50E",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fcan-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time.md"},markdown:"We all want to be lean and muscular — or at least toned. However, we are in a paradox because the two objectives require opposite approaches. At least, that is what the fitness industry says.\n\nYou know the bodybuilder cycle: bulking up during cold periods (off-season), then cutting during hot periods.\n\nIsn’t there another way to build muscle and stay lean at the same time? In other words, lean gains, body recomposition, and maingain? Of course, it is possible. We need to understand the physiology of fat loss and muscle growth.\n\n# How do muscles grow?\n\nMuscle growth is an adaptation to regular acute stress. When resistance is applied to the muscle, it will adapt to manage that resistance in the future in a more efficient manner.\n\nIt does this by strengthing the neuromuscular connections and by increasing the size or number of the muscle fibers.\n\nHowever, the adaptation requires some resources. These are protein, water, energy, and some other micronutrients that sustain the process. The neuromuscular adaptation happens during rest.\n\n# How do we burn body fat?\n\nBody fat is stored (excess) energy. When we consume more energy than we need, that energy is not wasted but stored for later when we’ll possibly need it.\n\nThus, to burn body fat, we need to be in a state of energy deficiency, so that the body can use the stored energy — caloric deficit.\n\nNow, let’s think about it. To build muscle, we need to apply resistance to the muscles by going to the gym, provide energy, protein, water, and micronutrients, and recover (sleep).\n\nTo burn body fat, we need to be in a caloric deficit.\n\nWhy can’t these two happen at the same time? Muscle growth requires energy which can come from the body fat. Thus, we can build muscle and burn fat at the same time.\n\nAn important note here. If you are already under 10% body fat, then a slight caloric surplus is in order. By slight, I don’t mean 500kcal\u002Fday, but 5–10% of your daily needs. If you need 3000kcal\u002Fday, then a 150–300kcal surplus per day is enough.\n\nHowever, most people are not under 10% body fat, so you can be in a slight caloric deficit, lift weights, and still see body recomposition happening.\n\nYou can also be at energy maintenance; your body fat will support the energy required by muscle growth.\n\nSo you see, by applying basic physiology, we can debunk the myths surrounding us in the fitness industry.\n\nAlso, body recomposition is the best goal for everyone because it implies making fitness a lifestyle and not a short-term thing like bulking and cutting do. You are fit year-round for life.\n\nOf course, bulking and cutting are part of a lifestyle, but why put your body through that much weight change when you can go steady in the long term?"};g[2]={id:"how-much-money-should-you-waste-on-a-car",author:a,title:"How Much Money Should You Waste On A Car",createdOn:"Sep 4, 2021",categories:e,description:"You will always lose money.",imageCredit:"Photo by Dhiva Krishna on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FX16zXcbxU4U",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fhow-much-money-should-you-waste-on-a-car.md"},markdown:"*Romanian video version [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=i3dzMOB73wc).*\n\nCars have become the manifestation of wealth. If a person owns a good-looking car or a specific brand, then that person is somebody important.\n\nHowever, many people don’t have enough money to from month to month, but they have an expensive car. It happens just so other people can validate them and increase their self-esteem.\n\nYes, people who show off with what they own are people with low self-esteem. So, before buying fancy cars, clothes, and jewelry to impress people, better focus on the root cause of this desire.\n\nA car is a tool to take you from point A to point B with a grade of comfort. Most cars cant take us here and there, but the comfort, looks, branding, and quality are different. For these four attributes, we pay the price.\n\nOf course, we all want a car that gives us a bit of comfort, especially if we travel by car a lot, and we want the car to be reliable. However, no matter the reliability, we will still need to invest in it like in a child.\n\nMake no mistake; a car is not an investment (asset) but a liability. For this reason, we need to choose it based on our income. Regardless we pick a fancy car if we don’t have the money to buy gas (or electricity) and maintain it.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to buy a car worth your four-month income. If your monthly income is $2000, you can afford an $8000 car. If your monthly income is $1000, you can afford a $4000 car.\n\nIt may sound too little, but it is the reality. Instead of wasting more money on a car, you would better focus on increasing your wealth by investing in assets: stocks, real estate, crypto, commodities.\n\nOr you can invest in yourself, develop new skills and get a better-paying job. The idea is to invest your money, not waste it on fancy stuff to fit in a fake society.\n"};g[3]={id:"stop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack",author:a,title:"Stop Doing This If You Want A Six-Pack",createdOn:h,categories:b,description:"Myth debunking.",imageCredit:"Photo by Jannes Jacobs on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FpMQgDg_8z88",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fstop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack.md"},markdown:"Everybody likes having a good-looking beach body, and this implies having a visible six-pack. The six-pack has become the proof of fitness. A person is not considered to be fit, especially men if they don’t have a six-pack.\n\nIt is kind of sad because people may not have the genetics for a six-pack. Look at “The Rock”; he is big and muscular but without a visible six-pack. Isn’t he fit? Of course, he is.\n\nAlso, for women is harder than for men to have a visible six-pack because of hormones. However, having a slim waist is an indicator of fitness for both men and women.\n\nFor this reason, no amount of crunches or leg raises will make your abdominal muscles visible if your body fat is too high or if you don’t have the genetics for a visible six-pack.\n\nStop looking at those freaks online with popped-up abs like corn. Those people are not natural and maybe not even healthy. Yes, in some cases having such shredded abs is not healthy, especially for women.\n\nAsk any woman with a shredded si-pack if her menstrual cycle and libido are in the correct parameters. I guarantee you they are not.\n\nI am lucky enough to have the visible six-pack genetics. For starters, I store most of my fat on my hips, and second, I have popped up abs without doing crunches.\n\nI only do leg raises with the main goal of making my core stronger. I know that I am better off walking for 10 minutes than doing core exercises to make my abs visible.\n\nAb workouts also don’t burn body fat around your abs. Spot reduction is a myth. The body (hormones and genetics) decides where to burn body fat.\n\nIf you want just to have a visible six-pack or just a slim waist, stop doing ab workouts and start burning more calories to lose the body fat around your waist."};g[4]={id:"my-5-simple-tricks-to-increase-your-self-confidence-to-the-roof",author:a,title:"My 5 Simple Tricks To Increase Your Self-Confidence To The Roof",createdOn:"Aug 20, 2021",categories:f,description:"Be your own superhero.",imageCredit:"Photo by King Lip on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FS9uB_IlDThw",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fmy-5-simple-tricks-to-increase-your-self-confidence-to-the-roof.md"},markdown:"There is no arguing that confidence is an important skill no so many people have. Heck, even I am still struggling with confidence from time to time. However, I found some tricks that work for me during dark times.\n\nHere’s the deal; our inner state fluctuates. We cannot be constantly happy and smiling. There are times when we are sad, angry, depressed, and it’s ok. We need to accept and understand this is temporary.\n\nWhen it comes to confidence, it is something built during childhood. If your parents and family were supportive, then you probably have confidence.\n\nIf your family was not there for you when you needed them the most, or you have some childhood traumas, as I do, then you probably have some struggles with confidence.\n\nNo worries, though. You are not doomed. You can start building your confidence if you accept you have some issues with this part. We all have issues in some areas because we are imperfect humans in constant need of improvement.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that every person has different focus points that make her confident.\n\nFor instance, some people are confident if they have money or a good-looking car, whereas others are confident if they have good-looking bodies or clothes.\n\nThe truth is, all of these external helpers for confidence are something that the inner child always craved.\n\nIn my case, self-confidence comes from being fit, wealthy, and having loving people around me. It is because I lacked these things during my childhood.\n\nHowever, self-confidence should be independent of external factors and only dependent on faith and love from within.\n\nThus, let’s see what you can do to increase your self-confidence.\n\n# 1. Take care of your body\n\nEvery person who eats, exercises, and sleeps well is feeling great. There is also an old saying: “Mens sana in corpore sano,” which translates to “A healthy mind in a healthy body.”\n\nYour mind cannot be well if your body is not well. If your mind is not well, your life cannot be well. Everything begins from the mind.\n\nThe first step to increase your self-confidence is to take care of your body. Eat healthy food, exercise regularly, set a sleep schedule, and become healthy and fit.\n\n# 2. Set and complete realistic goals\n\nIn other words, get things done. If you are procrastinating and doing nothing, your subconscious will think of you as a loser. There is nothing worse when you sabotage yourself.\n\nI also found that a life without goals is meaningless. Learn something new, develop some hobbies, start some projects. You will increase your self-confidence for sure because you know within you are successful.\n\n# 3. Improve your posture\n\nIt is silly, but it works. It makes sense if you think about it. When you stay straight, you send signals to your brain that you are open and ready to face the world. More about this  [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2009\u002F10\u002F091005111627.htm).\n\nWhen you are sad, depressed, or scared, your body’s response is to slouch and be small. It turns out that vice versa is also true. When you slouch and get small, you tend to be depressed and sad.\n\nOur body and mind are linked bidirectionally. It is the same when you force yourself to smile when you are sad. You cannot smile and be sad at the same time.\n\n# 4. Meditate\n\nThere is a lot of research on meditation and its benefits. Meditation’s primary purpose is to train your mind and be present. You are also facing your thoughts, emotions, and inner world.\n\nThrough meditation, you will develop the discipline to control yourself and to no longer be in reaction. You will become more confident, calmer, and happier. You will also be able to sleep better and focus better.\n\n# 5. Love and accept yourself\n\nJesus said: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” It means you should love yourself first. If you don’t love yourself, how dare you expect others to love you?\n\nYou are the one who spends the most time with yourself, so you better learn to know, accept, and love who you are. There is and always will be one of you in this life.\n\nDon’t be too rough on yourself and accept you made and will make mistakes. We all do.\n\nWhen you begin to love yourself, you will love the world, and what others say and do won’t affect you anymore. You will have faith and confidence in yourself."};g[5]={id:"what-i-hate-about-the-health-recommendations-for-you-know-what",author:a,title:"What I Hate About The Health Recommendations For \"You Know What\"",createdOn:"Aug 16, 2021",categories:d,description:"Sanitize the world.",imageCredit:"Photo by Online Marketing on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FhIgeoQjS_iE",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fwhat-i-hate-about-the-health-recommendations-for-you-know-what.md"},markdown:"Ever since this pandemic has begun, we have been bombarded with disinformation and professional health recommendations.\n\nI don’t know if you noticed, but all recommendations have been focusing on hygiene. Maybe there are some professional recommendations out there that make sense, but on the news, I heard and seen only this:\n\n-   sanitize everything you can;\n-   avoid people;\n-   stay incubated.\n\nAll recommendations focus on the external, not the internal, especially on sanitization. I am not saying we should not be clean; on the contrary. I am a big fan of washing my hands and no putting my hands in my mouth.\n\nHowever, I am not a fan of over-cleaning. Overdoing or underdoing anything is not good. Excess hygiene destroys our microbiome (trillions of bacteria on the body), which are involved in our immunity — among other things (“The Hygiene Hypothesis”).\n\n### What about our immune system?\n\nThe main idea is it is uncertainty about “you know what.” We know almost nothing about it or (they) hide what we know to create mass manipulation. I don’t know and don’t want to be a part of conspiracy theories without facts.\n\nWhat I do know is our first and primary defense system against any pathogen is our immune system. No one can contradict me on this one.\n\nThink of vaccines, for instance. What do they do? They train the immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pathogen. It’s still the immune system that does the job.\n\nAntibiotics and other pharmaceuticals either destroy all life within us (“anti” — against, “bios” — life) either help the immune system.\n\nSo, isn’t it common sense to receive information on how to make our immune system stronger? Just think about it. I am so frustrated because there are no recommendations on how to improve our immune system.\n\nMaybe because they couldn’t make money out of this? Or because they don’t care about us (MJ knew it)? Or maybe, because a strong immune system is enough?\n\nYou do the judgment call. What I am saying is regardless of what happens, you should focus on improving the immune system. It is our only defense against pathogens, tumors, and the majority of illnesses.\n\n### My habits for a strong immunity\n\n-   relaxing and stress management;\n-   good quality sleep (11:00 p.m. — 07:00 a.m.);\n-   exercise;\n-   vitamin D supplement;\n-   fish oil supplement;\n-   lots of vegetables;\n-   lean animal products for protein;\n-   lots of water;\n-   I limit chemicals on my body and using organic washing products.\n\nI found that chronic or excessive stress has the highest negative impact on my immune system. Whenever I have a lot of (psychological, emotional, or physical) stress, I “catch” a cold or some illness. It also happens when I don’t sleep well.\n\nIt is why stress management and sleep are the most important for my immune system. If I can’t do something good, at least I make sure I don’t do something bad.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.
