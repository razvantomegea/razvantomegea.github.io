However, the process is not as easy as said. Some people obtain a caloric deficit naturally by feeling full very fast with few calories.\n\nI need a lot of food to feel satisfied (~1kg). Of course, I can try to eat slower, have smaller portions, eat more often, but that is not my thing. The truth is, **I love to eat a lot of food**.\n\nIf you feel me, you are probably like me. Fortunately, I managed to come with a recipe for staying fit while also eating a lot of food and not counting calories.\n\nThe recipe can be applied **anywhere, anytime, and for free**. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n### 1. Eliminate fat sources\n\n**Oil, butter, margarine, animal fat, nuts, seeds,** and anything containing them. In other words, (I) eat foods low in fat or without fat at all. The only **exception is fatty cold-water fish** which has the EPAs and DHAs (omega-3s).\n\nWe do not require that much fat because **our body is very good at producing fat on its own; the same story for sugars**.\n\nWe need to provide food high in essential nutrients: **water, protein** (some amino acids), **omega-3s** from cold-water fatty fish (omega-6s we have enough), **vitamins, minerals, and fiber** (a bit debatable).\n\nThus, foods high in water, protein, omega-3s, vitamins, minerals, and fiber are **vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products (+ fatty cold-water fish)**.\n\nOf course, you can also eat bread, rice, pasta, corn, or legumes on the side. You can also **enjoy once per week some pizza or something out of the rules**. I like to eat shawarma on Sundays and some cookies from time to time.\n\nYou should listen to your body if you have cravings, but do not overdo it. If you crave potato chips or french fries every day, we have a problem. You may not have cravings but bad habits.\n\n### 2. Don’t drink your calories\n\nThe next time you drink three beers or a Starbucks combo, think again. These two may be worth 500 kcalories, equivalent to a meal.\n\n**Beer, cocktails, soda, coffee with cream, energy drinks, fruit juices, and sugary drinks** must be avoided or kept only for one day per week.\n\nThe idea is simple: **fluid calories don’t make you full but make you crave them more**.\n\nI drink only **water, black coffee, non-calorie sweetened\u002Funsweetened tea, and low-calorie alcoholic drinks** (dry wine, tequila, brandy).\n\nIf you like sodas, substitute them with zero-calorie versions. They may not be healthier but will help you for sure keep away the fat.\n\n### 3. Walk as your life depends on it\n\nI walk **8000–15000 steps per day,** equivalent to 350–700kcal. **Walking is independent of weather, equipment, time, and location**. Your only excuse is comfort or a health condition (I am deeply sorry if that is the case).\n\nI wrote an article on walking which you can check [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4).\n\nAre you traveling? You can walk and visit. Are you working? You can go to work and back on foot. You can go shopping on foot when you don’t have too much to buy.\n\nYou can put some audiobooks or listen to podcasts while walking. It’s the most versatile exercise one can do. You also don’t need recovery from walking. If you’re in a hurry or want to boost the cardio benefits, you can increase the pace or elevation.\n\nThese are my three rules for staying lean without trying. I hope you found them useful, and I invite you to leave a comment with your tricks on how to stay lean."};e[1]={id:"can-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time",author:a,title:"Can You Really Build Muscle And Burn Fat At The Same Time?",createdOn:f,categories:b,description:"Is body recomposition real?",imageCredit:"Photo by Damir Spanic on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FCs73R4ZO50E",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fcan-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time.md"},markdown:"We all want to be lean and muscular — or at least toned. However, we are in a paradox because the two objectives require opposite approaches. At least, that is what the fitness industry says.\n\nYou know the bodybuilder cycle: bulking up during cold periods (off-season), then cutting during hot periods.\n\nIsn’t there another way to build muscle and stay lean at the same time? In other words, lean gains, body recomposition, and maingain? Of course, it is possible. We need to understand the physiology of fat loss and muscle growth.\n\n# How do muscles grow?\n\nMuscle growth is an adaptation to regular acute stress. When resistance is applied to the muscle, it will adapt to manage that resistance in the future in a more efficient manner.\n\nIt does this by strengthing the neuromuscular connections and by increasing the size or number of the muscle fibers.\n\nHowever, the adaptation requires some resources. These are protein, water, energy, and some other micronutrients that sustain the process. The neuromuscular adaptation happens during rest.\n\n# How do we burn body fat?\n\nBody fat is stored (excess) energy. When we consume more energy than we need, that energy is not wasted but stored for later when we’ll possibly need it.\n\nThus, to burn body fat, we need to be in a state of energy deficiency, so that the body can use the stored energy — caloric deficit.\n\nNow, let’s think about it. To build muscle, we need to apply resistance to the muscles by going to the gym, provide energy, protein, water, and micronutrients, and recover (sleep).\n\nTo burn body fat, we need to be in a caloric deficit.\n\nWhy can’t these two happen at the same time? Muscle growth requires energy which can come from the body fat. Thus, we can build muscle and burn fat at the same time.\n\nAn important note here. If you are already under 10% body fat, then a slight caloric surplus is in order. By slight, I don’t mean 500kcal\u002Fday, but 5–10% of your daily needs. If you need 3000kcal\u002Fday, then a 150–300kcal surplus per day is enough.\n\nHowever, most people are not under 10% body fat, so you can be in a slight caloric deficit, lift weights, and still see body recomposition happening.\n\nYou can also be at energy maintenance; your body fat will support the energy required by muscle growth.\n\nSo you see, by applying basic physiology, we can debunk the myths surrounding us in the fitness industry.\n\nAlso, body recomposition is the best goal for everyone because it implies making fitness a lifestyle and not a short-term thing like bulking and cutting do. You are fit year-round for life.\n\nOf course, bulking and cutting are part of a lifestyle, but why put your body through that much weight change when you can go steady in the long term?"};e[2]={id:"stop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack",author:a,title:"Stop Doing This If You Want A Six-Pack",createdOn:f,categories:b,description:"Myth debunking.",imageCredit:"Photo by Jannes Jacobs on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FpMQgDg_8z88",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fstop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack.md"},markdown:"Everybody likes having a good-looking beach body, and this implies having a visible six-pack. The six-pack has become the proof of fitness. A person is not considered to be fit, especially men if they don’t have a six-pack.\n\nIt is kind of sad because people may not have the genetics for a six-pack. Look at “The Rock”; he is big and muscular but without a visible six-pack. Isn’t he fit? Of course, he is.\n\nAlso, for women is harder than for men to have a visible six-pack because of hormones. However, having a slim waist is an indicator of fitness for both men and women.\n\nFor this reason, no amount of crunches or leg raises will make your abdominal muscles visible if your body fat is too high or if you don’t have the genetics for a visible six-pack.\n\nStop looking at those freaks online with popped-up abs like corn. Those people are not natural and maybe not even healthy. Yes, in some cases having such shredded abs is not healthy, especially for women.\n\nAsk any woman with a shredded si-pack if her menstrual cycle and libido are in the correct parameters. I guarantee you they are not.\n\nI am lucky enough to have the visible six-pack genetics. For starters, I store most of my fat on my hips, and second, I have popped up abs without doing crunches.\n\nI only do leg raises with the main goal of making my core stronger. I know that I am better off walking for 10 minutes than doing core exercises to make my abs visible.\n\nAb workouts also don’t burn body fat around your abs. Spot reduction is a myth. The body (hormones and genetics) decides where to burn body fat.\n\nIf you want just to have a visible six-pack or just a slim waist, stop doing ab workouts and start burning more calories to lose the body fat around your waist."};e[3]={id:"which-exercise-is-best-for-you-if-you-want-to-burn-fat",title:"Which Exercise Is Best For You If You Want To Burn Fat?",author:a,createdOn:"Aug 7, 2021",categories:g,description:"Walking vs. Running vs. Weight Lifting.",imageCredit:"Photo by Bruno Nascimento on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FPHIgYUGQPvU",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fwhich-exercise-is-best-for-you-if-you-want-to-burn-fat.md"},markdown:"I am not turning into those guys who promote specific exercises for a higher fat loss. For what is worth, I think most of them are bullshit.\n\nI am also talking about spot reduction. Does any of the ads: “10-minute Ab Workout To Melt Belly Fat” or “Best Exercises For Thin Legs” ring a bell? Trust me; spot reduction is a myth.\n\nThe body decides based on hormones and genetics where to store and from where to burn fat. It’s out of our control.\n\nThe only thing we can do is manage our calories and ensure we burn more than we consume — or consume less than we burn.\n\nWe will analyze the most popular exercise routines and see which burns the most calories (fat).\n\n# Strength training\n\nI am sorry to break your bubble, but strength training burns the least amount of calories. Strength training is not for burning fat necessarily, but for improving body composition by increasing contractile tissue.\n\nDepending on your body weight, age, and gender, you may burn around (+\u002F- 100kcal) 300 kcal per hour of strength training. We are excluding any form of cardio from this.\n\nAlso, during that hour of training, we are doing it intensely with a maximum of 1–2 minutes rest between sets and reps (on the timer).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*TcIKZFBwB-mQaJvpTGCZ4Q.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nStrength training is a high-intensity interval training regimen and cannot be maintained for long periods. It has a high impact on the nervous system, muscular system, and cardiovascular system.\n\nIf someone works out for more than one and a half hours, he’s either wasting time, either doing some cardio, either is on PEDs.\n\nAccording to our human physiology, this form of exercise relies on glycogen and blood glucose for energy. Body fat is almost untouched during the session.\n\nAlso, building more muscle will increase your resting metabolic rate, which means you will burn more calories doing nothing. It’s kind of an investment.\n\nCombine this knowledge with the fact that strength training burns few calories, for sure strength training is not for fat loss, but muscle building and general health and wellbeing.\n\n# Running\n\nRunning is medium to high intensity aerobic exercise, depending on the pace. This type of exercise burn the most amount of energy per hour, some of it (25%) coming from body fat during the session.\n\nIt is for this reasons why most people choose running for fat loss. Aerobic exercise relies mostly on body fat for energy and it also burns a lot of calories.\n\nRunning for one hour at 8 miles per hour (12 km\u002Fh) burns around 1000 kcal (+\u002F- 200 kcal). It is 3 times more than strength training. Even running for 30 minutes burns more than strength training.\n\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*EolPGk2S9_Zt1X_ah9kzqQ.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nHowever, running alone for long periods of times may also burn muscle mass as it is catabolic and doesn’t stimulate muscle growth. If you don’t believe me, look at all the runners (not sprinters) out there and decide for yourself.\n\nRunning is also taxing your cardiovascular and nervous system and cannot be performed daily. I found running fun from time to time, but cannot do it more than once or twice per week.\n\nIn conclusion, running burns the most amount of calories, improves the cardiovascular system, but cannot be done often.\n\n# Walking\n\nWalking is my favorite form of exercise. I wrote an article about walking [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4). I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.\n\nI like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.\n\nWalking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+\u002F- 100 kcal).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nIt is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.\n\nWith all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.\n\n-   strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;\n-   running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;\n-   walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.\n\nThe winner is walking because of the consistency. Slow, long-term consistent progress will always beat fat, short-term progress.\n\nHowever, walking does not improves any muscle, neither skeletal, nor cardiovascular. Make no mistake, strength training and running may not burn more calories, but they do offer more health and fitness benefits than walking.\n\nIn my opinion, all three forms of exercise must be incorporated and combined in ones lifestyle for health and fitness purposes.\n\nI do include them, however I must work on my running (medium intensity aerobic exercise) routine, as I skip it because it makes me very tired.\n\n**What are your favorite exercises?

In other words, **eat every three hours**.\n\nWhat if I told you this is **the biggest bull-shit and stupidity we have ever heard and made** since our human evolution?\n\nThink about it; we are the only species on the planet that eat every two or three hours per day. Every **other species eats and stops for hours or days**.\n\nOk, maybe herbivores eat all day, but we are not herbivores. Even they fast during the winter when there are no more leaves or grasses.\n\n**Fasting is a natural process** with many benefits, and we are preventing stealing these benefits from our bodies.\n\n# Storytime\n\nI started to learn how to eat correctly in 2005 when I went to the doctor because **I was too fat**. He told me that a balanced diet should include three meals a day and two snacks.\n\nWell, I lost weight, but not with advice. I started doing **intermittent fasting without even knowing** about it. Of course, I also changed what I ate, not only how I ate.\n\nI also started playing sports — handball. I had training at 8:00 a.m., and I couldn’t eat in the morning because I would throw up during the practice because of the intensity. So, I skipped breakfast and ate when I got back home.\n\nMy first meal was at 10:30–11:00 a.m.. I also ate at school and 7:00–8:00 p.m. So, **I was fasting for 14–16 hours** without even knowing it at 11 years old. Of course, I was **also in a caloric deficit**.\n\nAs a result, I lost 20kg in 2 years. I also had a 6-pack without doing crunches.\n\n# The Fitness Industry Corrupted Me\n\nAfter years, I started going to the gym and reading fitness blogs. I read that to build muscle and boost metabolism, you need to **eat every 2–3 hours. Otherwise, muscles won’t grow but shrink.**\n\nI followed this advice for years, and I **did not have a life**. Everywhere I want I had to plan to be exactly after my last meal. In other cases, I needed to have a meal packed with me all the time. It was a pain in the ass.\n\n**I was living to eat, not eating to live.** Fitness and food controlled my life.\n\nAfter a while, I started to learn about human physiology and hormones. I came across a doctor who said we were skipping breakfast and fasting and explained why. I was interested, so I started to learn more.\n\nI learned about fasting and its benefits to health and fitness, so I applied it to my lifestyle. It was a total failure. Why? Because I didn’t track my calories. I learned that **fasting without being in a caloric deficit does not affect fat loss**.\n\nIn the end, the best approach to fat loss for me was intermittent fasting combine with caloric deficit or maintenance.\n\n# Why intermittent fasting?\n\nFasting for at least sixteen hours puts the body into a state of lipolysis, ketosis, and cellular autophagy. In other words, you enter **fat-burning and healing mode**.\n\nIn more detail, fasting can improve biomarkers, have anti-aging benefits, have metabolic benefits[[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fintermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156)[[2]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC5783752\u002F), and prevent cancer[[3]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC6938162\u002F). The last one is obvious because of cellular autophagy.\n\nThere are many other benefits if you begin to search for research studies on this topic. In Layman’s terms, **fasting heals the body and triggers fat-burning mode.**\n\n# Fasting is not for every one\n\nOf course, fasting is not for everyone. If you are pregnant, a child below ten years old, or have medical issues, then fasting may not be for you.\n\nYou should consult your doctor before starting any routine.\n\n# How I fast\n\nI fast between 8:00–9:00 p.m. until 12:00–1:00 p.m. I also exercise on an empty stomach (cardio o strength training) because **fasting does not burn muscle**[[5]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=teQIaU6wp2o&t=7s).\n\nDuring my fast, I drink only water, herbal tea, and black coffee, without milk or sweeteners.\n\nSometimes, I fast for 24 hours, sometimes for 14. Sometimes I skip fasting because of some events. However, I fast 16 hours 6 times per week.\n\nEver since I started to fast, I feel free, and I control my weight and lifestyle, not the other way around.\n\n# References\n\n1.

However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n# Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n# Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fyou-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n# Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n# A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n# Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n# Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fmy-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n# A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n# Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n# Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n# Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional. Everything I write on the topic is for informational and educational purposes only.
