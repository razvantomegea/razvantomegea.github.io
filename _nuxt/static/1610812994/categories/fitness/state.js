If you don’t know or believe this, you are lying to yourself.\r\n\r\nAny sustainable way to achieve this is good for losing fat for life. In this article, we will talk about the best exercise for losing fat. It is not only the best exercise, but maybe the best, easy, and simple way to lose fat.\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is? It is not what you expect. It doesn’t involve any complex or heavy movement. It is “put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down.”\r\n\r\n### Put the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks down\r\n\r\nThe exercise of stopping from eating is the best exercise for losing fat. The premise is simple: you can’t ever out-exercise a chaotic diet.\r\n\r\nThe average exercise session burns 500kcal per day. The average resting metabolic rate is 1500kcal per day. Let’s assume we have 300kcal per day of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and thermic effect from food.\r\n\r\nWe have a 2300kcal average energy burn per day, and it is not much. 2300kcal is a large pizza and one soda. Who can live in one day with only that food? I wouldn’t and couldn’t.\r\n\r\nSo we see that only 30% (at maximum) of our daily energy consumption is from physical exercise. The rest is from our metabolism and day to day movement.\r\n\r\nThe only simple and efficient way to lose body fat is through diet control, which is what putting the fork\u002Fspoon\u002Fchopsticks (or hand if you eat like a pig like me) down.\r\n\r\nYou can lose fat without moving a finger, only by tracking your meals. Exercise is not for fat loss. Exercise is for body recomposition, health, and longevity.\r\n\r\nI track my meals with [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), the health and fitness app developed by me. It is still a work in progress, but hopefully, I will launch it this year.\r\n\r\n\u003E The takeaway is this, you will never lose weight if you have no idea how many calories you are eating and burning. The moment I stopped tracking my daily energy intake and consumption it the moment I started gaining body fat.\r\n\r\nThe people who are fit and don’t know what they are eating have a higher than average metabolism or are getting full fast and with small meals (like my girlfriend). They are in a caloric deficit or maintenance in the background.\r\n\r\nI need to eat 1kg of food in one sitting to get full. I eat around 2kg of food daily to not feel hungry. I lose fat because I eat foods high in volume and low in calories, like vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products. I am fit because I track almost everything 5 out of 7 days.\r\n\r\nShould you listen to me? Of course not. I am not a health and fitness professional. I am just sharing my own experience and the lessons learned from [The Science of Nutrition](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FScience-Nutrition-2nd-Janice-Thompson\u002Fdp\u002F032164316X), Athlean-X (Jeff Cavaliere), Greg Doucette, Jeff Nippard, and Kinobody (Greg O’Gallagher). It’s your choice what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful, give it some claps and share it with your friends. You can leave a comment on what you would like for me to write in the future. Also, how can I improve? I would appreciate it very much."};g[1]={id:"I-stopped-taking-muscle-building-and-fat-burning-supplements",author:a,title:"I Stopped Taking Muscle Building And Fat Burning Supplements.

I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[2]={id:"why-walking-is-the-best-exercise",author:a,title:"Why Walking Is The Best Exercise",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2020",categories:c,description:"I am a big fan of walking.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n### Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n### No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n### Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n### Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n### Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.

If you still do not believe this, you are lying to yourself. The biggest issue with this approach is inaccuracy. We cannot predict 100% how much calories we consume and burn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt becomes less trivial when we are not home eating our prepared foods or when we don't have the time and information and track everything.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is to be aware of what foods have the least calories and which have the most.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong all foods, these two food groups have prevented me from being in shape and, for sure, millions more.\r\n\r\n# Fats & Oils\r\n\r\nFats and oils are the highest calorie foods on the planet because they are pure fat and have ~900kcal per 100g. Fats and oils are in sauces, chips, dressings, fried foods, cakes, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if it's coconut oil, olive oil, or whatever healthy oil you may find: it is still fattening. If you are cooking and need some fat, use a cooking spray; it prevents you from adding too much fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAvoid fats and oils and foods containing them in high amounts as much as possible. You can easily tell which foods contain these ingredients only by looking at them or reading the label.\r\n\r\n# Nuts & Seeds\r\n\r\nAfter fats and oils, nuts and seeds are the second-worst foods to consume if you are trying to burn some fat. Nuts and seeds are ~60% fat and have around 600kcal per 100g. Not only that, but they are low in volume and highly palatable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a blink of an eye, you finished a bag of cashews, pistachios, or pumpkin seeds of 1000kcal, and you are still hungry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like snacking when watching a game or movie, try something low in fat like popcorn (without butter) or fat-free chips. If you are drinking, you shouldn't be snacking in the first place, as alcohol increases your appetite.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you cannot quit nuts and seeds, choose the ones in the shell and don't eat more than one fist.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[4]={id:"is-a-six-pack-worth-it",author:a,title:"Is A Six-Pack Worth It?

It is easy when you're living alone and isolated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI've isolated myself for five years to focus on my career, health, and fitness, and it has cost me dearly. I've lost my social skills, and I can come as anti-social. I am not anti-social, not anymore at least, but I have a little social anxiety. If I think about it, I am causing my discomfort because I don't have my food, and I am not in my habitat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy obsessions with being fit all the time prevent me from having fun and feeling good from time to time on weekends. As hard as I am trying to hide this, people can tell, and it is not cool.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, because of my trauma from childhood when I was overweight, I have come to believe that only if I were to be fit could I be accepted in society. It sucks how some childhood trauma can affect your entire life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to make a balance between social life and my goals through portion control. If we think about it, if I eat correctly five-six days per week, on day of cheating won't do any harm if done correctly. I know that fatty foods are the enemy, so I always eat the slimmest food on the table. When it comes to alcohol, I also choose low-calorie alcohol drinks and avoid soft drinks (I don't like them).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf anything slim or low calorie is available, I consume small, minimal, portions, just enough to not be impolite, because that's what is all about.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go off-road from your plan a day per week, but then you are back on track the following six days, it is perfect. **If the long-term trend is up, it doesn't matter if, from time to time, there are some short-term downtrends**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the end, we are social beings, and **we cannot sacrifice our social life for anything in the world. It doesn't matter if you are rich, famous, fit, and good looking if you are alone and have no one with whom to share your success and happiness.** With patience and dedication, we can balance everything. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};g[5]={id:"health-and-fitness-myths",author:a,title:"Health And Fitness Myths You’re Probably Believing",createdOn:"Sep 29, 2020",categories:c,description:"The main reason I started this blog is to deliver unbiased, quality information from different aspects of our lives.

I like to **question everything and think outside the box**, and I invite you to take this as an example.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in a student, **teachers taught 20th-century technology and knowledge**. My girlfriend is a medical student, and she approves that medicine professors teach 20th-century medicine as well.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMost professors and PhDs stop researching and reading the latest discoveries in science, so they rely on old studies and knowledge. Not to say that **most of the research studies are biased or read incorrectly.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy point is, **don't take everything for granted**, even from professionals. Question everything, and do your research.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's see some common myths in health and fitness that are wrong.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Cholesterol in eggs is bad\r\n\r\nEggs yolks contain cholesterol, and high blood cholesterol damages the heart. Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCholesterol is **required to help the body synthesize vitamin D and testosterone.** Cholesterol may come from food or can be synthesized by the liver.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because we eat something, high cholesterol doesn't mean we will have high blood cholesterol. There are people with low cholesterol diets that have high triglycerides because they eat a lot of sugar. Also, having **high total blood cholesterol is not bad.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat we call blood cholesterol are lipoproteins of different densities and triglycerides. If you ever did a blood cholesterol test, you probably saw: LDL (and VLDL), HDL, triglycerides, and total lipids. From these numbers, **all that matters is the HDL ratio to the rest of the lipids**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe higher the HDL and the lower the LDL + triglycerides, the healthier you are. Total blood cholesterol is irrelevant. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you with cholesterol tracking and numbering.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen we consume good quality eggs with the yolk, both our HDL and LDL may rise in harmony. Eggs also have amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. They are the perfect food unless you have an allergy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, check Dr. Joseph Mercola's and Chris Kresser's articles ([this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.huffpost.com\u002Fentry\u002Fthe-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKm1it8M9nlsjkhKEVN3T8tq2lwVxTh-4yIpIQftbyHkAKS6MekYGz9KnZOG1qLkH7NW7ozbHbqnXRgnr3pp9z4gUfgNddtLMPnRkixnAfvE0zhkhqel8feSfxoXAuPMTx1NNViz1J757oZCm5br8Qw-mAky4h7VxtMgNSu77JSS&guccounter=2), [this](https:\u002F\u002Fchriskresser.com\u002Fthree-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away\u002F), and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mercola.com\u002Finfographics\u002Fcholesterol-levels.htm)).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Spot reduction\r\n\r\nDo crunches, and you'll lose belly fat. Do squats or lunges, and you'll lose fat from the legs. Unfortunately, we cannot force our bodies to burn fat from where we want. **The place we accumulate body fat is dictated by our genes and by our hormones**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only way to **lose body fat from all the places is through a** [**calorie (energy) deficit**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fdo-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Eating at night makes you fat.\r\n\r\nDon't eat after six o'clock, that's what they say. Wrong!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter when you eat. If your goal is to lose body fat, your only focus should be low calories and high satiety (high protein, fiber, and water). When you eat or how you spread your meals is your choice. If you are always full and in a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat without even trying.\r\n\r\n# Myth: 8 hours of sleep at night\r\n\r\nHow much sleep we need is **dictated by our age, gender, lifestyle, and genetics**. We are not the same, and general recommendations will never work. Some people can are fresh in 6 hours, other in 10.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMore important than sleep quantity is sleep quality. If you sleep 6 hours and are ready to move mountains, you're good to go. **Always listen to your body**, not to medical professionals. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you track your sleep and tell you about your sleep quality.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fast-food makes you fat.\r\n\r\n**No food makes you fat as well as no food makes you lose fat**. If you're eating only from fast-food but are in a calorie deficit, you'll lose fat. Also, if you eat only non-processed, non-GMO, organic, Saint, purified, energized, heavenly food but are in a calorie surplus, you'll gain fat. It is Isaac Newton science.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Alcohol makes you fat\r\n\r\nAlcohol can make you fat if you are eating afterward or while drinking. **Alcohol dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, the satiety and hunger hormones, and causes you to eat more.** If you also drink beer, which has a lot of calories, you'll gain fat for sure if you're in a calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to drink, do not overdo it, choose low-calorie drinks, and eat only before. I drink at a maximum of 1 bottle of dry wine per week, if not per month.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fruit makes you fat because of fructose\r\n\r\nIt is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. How can you say watermelon, which has 30kcal per 100g, makes you fat. I ate this summer 1kg of watermelon per day and lost body fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like how Greg Doucette said: \"I am sure people are overweight and obese because they are eating to much fruit.\" It still makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain and for the last time, **excess calories and only calories make you gain body fat**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   egg yolks are healthy, and you can eat as much as you like, as long as you don't abuse (3-5\u002Fday is ok);\r\n-   genetics and hormones dictate where you store fat;\r\n-   genetics, age, gender, and lifestyle dictate how much sleep you need;\r\n-   alcohol makes you fat indirectly by making you eat more;\r\n-   no food and drink cause weight loss or weight gain directly, only calories.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n***Want more Q&As or myths debunked?
