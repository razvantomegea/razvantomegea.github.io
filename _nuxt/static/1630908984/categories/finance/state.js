If a person owns a good-looking car or a specific brand, then that person is somebody important.\n\nHowever, many people don’t have enough money to from month to month, but they have an expensive car. It happens just so other people can validate them and increase their self-esteem.\n\nYes, people who show off with what they own are people with low self-esteem. So, before buying fancy cars, clothes, and jewelry to impress people, better focus on the root cause of this desire.\n\nA car is a tool to take you from point A to point B with a grade of comfort. Most cars cant take us here and there, but the comfort, looks, branding, and quality are different. For these four attributes, we pay the price.\n\nOf course, we all want a car that gives us a bit of comfort, especially if we travel by car a lot, and we want the car to be reliable. However, no matter the reliability, we will still need to invest in it like in a child.\n\nMake no mistake; a car is not an investment (asset) but a liability. For this reason, we need to choose it based on our income. Regardless we pick a fancy car if we don’t have the money to buy gas (or electricity) and maintain it.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to buy a car worth your four-month income. If your monthly income is $2000, you can afford an $8000 car. If your monthly income is $1000, you can afford a $4000 car.\n\nIt may sound too little, but it is the reality. Instead of wasting more money on a car, you would better focus on increasing your wealth by investing in assets: stocks, real estate, crypto, commodities.\n\nOr you can invest in yourself, develop new skills and get a better-paying job. The idea is to invest your money, not waste it on fancy stuff to fit in a fake society.\n"};e[1]={id:"the-only-technical-indicator-you-need-to-make-outrageous-profits",author:b,title:"The Only Technical Indicator You Need To Make Outrageous Profits",createdOn:"May 11, 2021",categories:a,description:"Keep it simple.",imageCredit:"Photo by Maxim Hopman on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@nampoh?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fthe-only-technical-indicator-you-need-to-make-outrageous-profits.md"},markdown:"I posted  [an article](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fthe-capital\u002Fthe-only-3-technical-analysis-tools-youll-ever-need-to-increase-your-profits-5b163453cc04)  this year about the only three technical indicators we need to make profits. It turned out we only need one. Not only that, but this indicator provides a higher profit with a lower risk. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n# 50-day EMA\n\nFirst of all, we need to set up the chart style. We will only use the  **weekly and daily Heikin Ashi chart**. We will never look at charts below one day because it is too much noise.\n\nWe always look  in the long run, and we need to be patient and live our lives. The 50-day EMA on the weekly chart is a good long-term trend indicator.\n\n-   green Heikin Ashi candle above EMA (on both daily and weekly chart), we buy;\n-   we exit when a strong (no up shadows) red Heikin Ashi candle occurs on the weekly chart;\n-   red Heikin Ashi candle below EMA (on both daily and weekly chart), we sell;\n-   we exit when a strong (no down shadows) green Heikin Ashi candle occurs on the weekly chart.\n\nThat’s all. That is my strategy, backtested with many markets and assets, and the winning trades are at least three times greater than the losing trades.

However, they are wrong when they say gold, stocks, or cash have intrinsic value.\n\n# History of money\n\nIn the beginning, we used  **bartering**  as a form of transacting value —  **a medium of exchange**. People traded  **a cow for two sheep,**  for example. The person who sold a specific service or good gave the value.\n\nThe cow produces  milk and meat, whereas the sheep provides both, but in smaller quantities. Thus, the buyer and seller may negotiate and agree that a cow is worth two or three sheep. Makes sense?\n\nOver time, people evolved and started using some  **common currency**  to have a more stable and standard valuation of goods and services.\n\nIt makes sense because a person may say that a cow is more valuable than a horse, while another person may say the exact contrary. People needed a  **standard value estimation — store of value**. Hence, people started minting gold coins.\n\n**People chose gold**  as a store of value because of its nature: it  **doesn’t oxidate,** it can be **modeled into weighed coins,** and  it is **scarce**. Gold has stood the test of time as the standard value — the gold standard — mostly because people agreed upon it.\n\nFor sure, there are other earthly elements with similar anti-oxidative properties and scarcity, but people agreed to gold. It is a  **convention given by people**, not by universal laws. I hope it makes sense.\n\nOver time people started putting their gold into safe deposits and received a  **paper that proved their deposited wealth**. People used those papers for transactions instead of physical gold, which was also harder to transport.\n\nThe gold deposits were the first banks. Over time, banks started giving  **papers for the same gold deposit**  when people wanted to borrow gold because people never withdrew their gold. They  **relied on the paper proof**  of gold and not the gold itself.\n\nIt is how the case monetary system came into existence. People came into agreement that the number printed on the paper is the actual value.\n\nFor decades, the paper money of a country was the equivalent of gold it possessed. All until president Richard Nixon exited from his gold standard in 1978. Since then,  **governments could print money as much as they wanted**.\n\nNote: I tried to describe the history of money as briefly as possible and may have skipped some details. If you want to learn more about the history of money, how banks work, and why our monetary system is broken, please check:\n\n-   [The History of Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002F07\u002Froots_of_money.asp)\n-   [Why Has Gold Always Been Valuable?](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002Finvesting\u002F071114\u002Fwhy-gold-has-always-had-value.asp#gold-psychology-and-society)\n-   [How Banks Create Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=O5DaC1Ujrrg)\n-   [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s)\n\n# Why Stocks Are Speculative\n\nAs we saw, commodities and cash have no value if people agree they do not. The story with stocks is a bit different. Stocks represent fractional ownership of a public company, according to  [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fstock.asp).\n\nYou may think a stock price goes up because the company’s profit goes up. We saw during the pandemic that  **although companies’ profits went down, stocks went up**.\n\nThe Buffet Indicator confirms that the stock market prices have detached from the current state of the economy.\n\nThe stock market — and other markets — went up because people started gambling on RobinHood, eToro, and other online brokerages during the pandemic.\n\nHow come people had money to invest during the pandemic? Because they could not travel, could not hang out, and stayed at home. The pandemic prevented people from spending, thus, reorienting them to online investing.\n\nSo, why does do markets go up on exchanges? Because people buy. It is the hard truth. When a  **lot of money goes into a stock, the stock goes up and vice versa.**  It is what happened with AMC and GameStop as well.\n\nAll of this means  **hype can create the illusion of value**. If most people agree Tesla has value and buy its stock, the stock will go up, and it did. It had a P\u002FE ratio (Price relative to Earnings) of almost 1000. Extremely overpriced.\n\n# Crypto hype is history repeating\n\nThe crypto hype is the new hype of the online and informational revolution. At the beginning of the century — and millennium — we had the internet hype — Dotcom bubble. In 1720, we had the South Sea bubble. Now, we have the Crypto bubble.\n\nYes, it is a bubbl**e because the market is new, prices spike quickly, and people become very greedy**. A new market is easy to manipulate through social media and online news (e.g., pump and dump or fud).\n\nAs we saw,  **Elon Musk tweets Doge and the price goes up 1000 times**. Dogecoin — and other meme coins — are a joke (literally). However, if people believe they have value, they will have value.\n\nNow, there are companies and projects with some fundamentals behind the chart.\n\nFor instance, if GOOGL’s price goes down, by just knowing and understanding the company’s fundamentals, you can predict the price will come back in the future. Why? Because the  **company itself has value, not the stock.**\n\nHowever, if everybody decided Google has no value for some reason (e.g., it steals personal information, another company is better), the company will go to hell.\n\nThe same logic applies to all markets, including crypto. I choose to invest in  **Ethereum**  because of its potential to become (decentralized) Web 3.0. I also choose to invest in  **Bitcoin**  because I believe it is a better alternative to gold.\n\n# Blockchain technology is the future\n\nThere is a book called  **“The Bitcoin Standard”**  which describes the current flaws of our monetary system and why  **Bitcoin, among other things, is a good store of value**.\n\nBitcoin is not and will not be the only crypto out there. Many crypto projects, like Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana, have huge potential.\n\nThe name  **cryptocurrency is not intuitive**, in my opinion. Crypto assets or blockchain projects are a better naming because crypto is not just for finance but for other applications in our world.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nIn whatever asset, be it stock, commodity, or crypto, money goes, the price will follow, as well as money outside the asset. This process makes any publicly traded asset prone to manipulation.\n\nThis makes you understand the everything has no value until people believe in it and give it value.\n\nIf I ask for my house $100.000, but no one will offer me that price, my price is not worth $100.000. As long as there is a person willing to pay the price, the good or service has that asked price (value), otherwise, it doesn’t.\n\nDespite the fud and misconceptions about crypto, it is here to stay. People will slowly believe crypto has value and will incorporate it into their lives. They first need to understand the potential crypto has and the problems it solves.\n\n----------\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

How do I know this? By looking at some fundamental market indicators and at the overall economy. We are at the **end of a big cycle like in 1929** before the Great Depression.\n\n# Pandemic\n\nThe thing is, our economy went to hell because of the pandemic, and we have not recovered. Even though now we have begun to travel again, people are **not spending like they used to**. This rhymes with what happened after World War I.\n\nIf you think the pandemic is over, think again. We will probably see **another lockdown during cold periods**. We have relaxed this summer because of vaccinations, but the percentage is still low. **In Romania, less than 30% are vaccinated**.\n\n# Hyperinflation\n\nStimulus after stimulus. The US and EU have been **printing money like never before**. Trillions of dollars and euros were printed this year and last year.

Currently, it is **strongly overvalued**.

We have never seen such disconnection in the stock market. If you look at the P\u002FE ratio of most stocks, even at the S&P 500, it is high and indicates overvaluation.\n\n# Overpriced real-estate\n\nHave you seen the prices of real estate in the past two years? The reason for this is that [**people have stopped selling their houses**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.realtor.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fdecember-2020-data\u002F) since the pandemic.

Because of all-time  [**low mortgage rates**](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.freddiemac.com\u002Fpmms\u002F)**.**\n\nNot only this, but the **prices of the building materials have also increased** a lot, besides inflation.\n\n# Crypto cycles\n\nThe crypto market flows according to the supply and demand of Bitcoin. **Every four years, the bitcoin reward for mining is cut in half (halving)**. The Bitcoin halving decreases the production of Bitcoin, hence, lower supply.\n\nAfter every Bitcoin halving, the crypto market starts the bull run, and everything goes up. Until Bitcoin is dethroned by Ethereum, we will still see these 4-year cycles.\n\nBecause of its scarcity, it [**follows the stock-to-flow model**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F).

I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**.

Not to mention the suicide rates.\n\nAlso, did you know that most **lottery winners end up broke**? That is the root cause of their misery.\n\nThe focus of this article is to make you change your perception of wealth. It is somehow counterintuitive to believe that making more money will make you wealthier.\n\n# Easy come, easy go\n\nIn S01:E14 of Two And A Half Men, Charlie goes broke. His accountant is trying to explain to him how this happened because Charlie was shocked. He gave a very intuitive explanation.\n\nHe made the analogy for cash flow by comparing it with water pouring inside a plastic cup with a hole at the bottom.\n\nWhen water comes inside the cup faster than it drains, the cup remains full for a while, even after the water stops flowing. Of course, this happens if the hole is only one and not too large.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, he had ten holes at the bottom of the cup, and as soon as water stopped coming, the cup stopped having water.\n\nThe analogy is simple: **if you spend more than you earn, you will always be poor.**\n\nIf you have zero or a negative balance in your wallet or bank account at the end of each month, then you are spending too much. You will not even realize this but will think you are not earning enough.\n\nSay you do find a solution to earn more money, and you succeed. Do you think it will fix the root cause of your case? In most cases, it will not because your mindset is the same.\n\n**The real issue you have a consumer mindset. When you have more, you think you afford more. As a result, you spend more.**\n\nIf you were to change your mindset from a consumer to an investor, you would realize you spend too much on liabilities and not on assets.\n\nAlso, you would see that more money equals more savings for possible investments and not more spending on things you do not need.\n\n# Exceptions to the rule\n\nI get it. You are already cutting your expenses at a minimum because you were not so fortunate. In your case, the solution is only to increase your income.\n\nThere is a catch to this exception, though. If you were to make more money, you would probably have the urge to compensate for all those years of lack of wealth.\n\nThe example above is what happened to me. I made more money than I ever needed, and still, I ended up borrowing money from others from time to time. Fortunately, I realized my issues and fixed them at the right moment.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nIf you are struggling with your money, look first at your expenses before trying to earn more.\n\n-   check your bills: are you wasting electricity, water, gas, etc.?\n-   check your transportation: can you walk or take the bus instead of the car?\n-   check your subscriptions: do you need Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Amazon Prime, etc.?\n-   check your shopping: do you need new clothes, new accessories, new devices, etc.?\n\nThe list continues but, in summary, adopt a minimalistic lifestyle. Think twice before clicking the buy button.\n\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
