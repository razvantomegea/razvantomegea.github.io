It was the first revolutionary alternative after WordPad.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMicrofost Office has powerful tools for any document, but it has a big issue many people like me don't like: it **costs $10\u002Fmonth**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat may not seem much, but in Romania, where the dollar is four times more valuable than in the USA, it is not cheap. Then again, why should I give this money when there is a better alternative: **Google Docs.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are cases where Google Docs can't compete with Microsoft Office, like when creating databases with Access. For the average user who wants only to create some tables, documents, and simple presentations, Google Docs does a good job for free.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about Google Docs is that it is **running in the browser**, so no need to download and install anything or worry about operating system compatibilities. You can also **add contributors to documents** and work on the same documents at once. You even have **version control** to see how the documents changed, and you can revert to previous versions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're worried about formats, Google Docs also does this for you. You can **import\u002Fexport PDF, ODT, TXT, DOC(X), and others**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can share with other users and so many online features; no more worries about having your document lost or destroyed because of local disk errors.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, [Google GSuite](https:\u002F\u002Fgsuite.google.com\u002F) does its job, and it may do it for you too. Full disclosure, Google doesn't pay me a cent for this article; it is just my good experience with their products that drove me to share this information with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n*If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.*"};return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1602226891",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:false,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:a,icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:b}],pageTitle:"TECH","mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:{},articles:c,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:c}},serverRendered:true,routePath:a,config:{}}}("\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech","Tech",Array(1)));
