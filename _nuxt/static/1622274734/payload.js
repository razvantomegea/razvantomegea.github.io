I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.\r\n\r\nThus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.\r\n\r\n### How and why the muscle grows?\r\n\r\nIn nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.\r\n\r\n\u003E The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.\r\n\r\nSimple, right?\r\n\r\nIt is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.\r\n\r\n### Workout structure\r\n\r\nYour workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only **compound movements** (multiple muscle groups per movement).\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to **avoid machines**, we will be using **only free weights and\u002For resistance bands**. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the exercises:\r\n\r\n-   chest: **bench press and incline bench press** (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);\r\n-   back: **pull-ups\u002Fchin-ups\u002Fpull-downs and rows**;\r\n-   legs: **squats and deadlifts** (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol\u002FBulgarian\u002Fsplit squats);\r\n-   shoulders: **shoulder press and lateral raises**;\r\n-   biceps: **curls**;\r\n-   triceps: **dips, push-downs, and\u002For skull crushers**;\r\n-   (optional) calves: calve raises**;**\r\n-   (optional) abs: leg raises.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.\r\n\r\n### Exercise execution\r\n\r\nHow we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.\r\n\r\nEach exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on **6–10 challenging reps**, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (**1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric**.)\r\n\r\nLet’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:\r\n\r\n-   when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);\r\n-   you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;\r\n-   when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).\r\n\r\nWe will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.\r\n\r\nFor the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.\r\n\r\n### Workout sessions\r\n\r\nYou can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:\r\n\r\n-   **push\u002Fpull\u002Flegs** (Monday to Saturday);\r\n-   **upper\u002Flower** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);\r\n-   **full-body** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n\r\nI do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.\r\n\r\n### Diet and sleep\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. **Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic**.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, **lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs & egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits**.\r\n\r\nIf you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You **don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements** unless you have money to spare.\r\n\r\nFor sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday**, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.\r\n\r\nI found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me. You can try it and experiment with your body if you like. The goal was to share my experience and knowledge with you and eliminate the noise from the fitness industry.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n\r\nWe all dream of being like superheroes (Thor, Captain America, Superman, Batman, etc.) or like our favorite Instagram influencer. However, we have been fed the delusion of the perfect body.\r\n\r\n\u003E 90% of the superhero movie actors and fitness influencers are not natural and have great genetics.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be disappointed when we don’t become like them and we think that the naturally fit (imperfect) body is not fit at all. Everyone has a different version of fitness.\r\n\r\nDon’t compare yourself with others, but with yourself from the past. If you are making progress, that’s all that matters. Health and fitness is a marathon — a journey and a lifestyle — not a sprint.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Il6rHJfkWBI5eYpFyZN2ng.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\u003E 12–14% body fat year round (no editing and not good lightning)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

We moved from greed to extreme fear in a month.  **The big issue is uncertainty: is the bull market over or not?**  What we know for sure is that we are in a dump.\r\n\r\nI may be a masochist, but this big dump was necessary. There were too many gamblers in the crypto space putting their money into shit coins that could go to the moon.\r\n\r\nNot to mention extremely greedy people who use high leverage or put all their money into coins without good fundamentals or without researching.\r\n\r\n\u003E “Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.” — Warren Buffet\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have been studying crypto and investing for only a year now. Until then, I have been also a gambler since 2017 in crypto and forex and I lost a lot of money. I was ready to quit, but then I decided to invest in learning.\r\n\r\nI am still in profit, which is fortunate, but I guarantee more than half the crypto “investors” are in a big loss. However, 75% of the crypto investors who are still holding are under stress, myself included.\r\n\r\nBefore we entered the crypto space, we needed to be prepared for this. I hope you didn’t think that crypto just goes up 10x and that is that — I was hoping it would; me like money.\r\n\r\nIf you are extremely stressed like me, it is because of these reasons.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose\r\n\r\nI put all my saved money into crypto. How greedy of me, right? A month ago I sold some profits into USDT and almost had all my initial investment cashed out.\r\n\r\nHowever, the dark devil from the left of my shoulder told me: “Look how everything goes up, don’t you want some more short-term profits? Don’t be a fool and buy, what can go wrong?”. Everything!\r\n\r\nI re-invested and now I regret it. I bought more than I was ready to lose, because of greed. Now, I deserve my well-learned lesson.\r\n\r\nThe money invested is also the money I need for a new well-needed car, which I should buy in a month. This brings us to our second lesson.\r\n\r\n# Don’t invest the money you need in the next 3 months\r\n\r\nCorrections happen every month around the 15th day and they may last for 2 months just to recover. If you invested a few days or weeks before this correction, you need to wait 3 months just to not be at a loss or in a small profit.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in cycles based on Bitcoin’s 4-year halving. When you invest in crypto, plan to hold for 4 years and there is a very high possibility you will be in profit.\r\n\r\n# Don’t check your portfolio every hour\r\n\r\nI repeat, crypto is highly volatile and you may see a 10% increase in an hour, and afterward a 10% decrease, or vice versa. It is also a waste of time and energy.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a swing trader, you should check your portfolio maximum at every 12 hours (2 times per day).\r\n\r\n# Have a plan\r\n\r\nAlways invest or trade with a plan. It doesn’t matter which market you choose, you always need to have a plan if you want to make profits.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a plan, you’re not an investor, nor a trader, but a gambler.\r\n\r\nI am a combination of investor and trader. I use fundamental analysis to choose a good asset but also use technical analysis to know when to enter and exit.\r\n\r\nMy mistake is that I didn’t exit Bitcoin a month ago when the  [indicators](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fpi-cycle-top-indicator\u002F) told me I should. Bitcoin kept going down and it is a matter of days or weeks until the entire crypto market follows it.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is the leader, where Bitcoin goes, crypto floes (sooner or later). There are also  [seasons](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F): Bitcoin season, altcoin season, major correction, repeat. Guess in which part we are now?\r\n\r\nI expect we are in half of the bull market and a big correction was necessary to mark this timestamp. The 200D MA supports Bitcoin, whereas the 50D MA supports the top altcoins\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F60\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fmiro.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1686\u002F1*BuGO-i-FPRelJKhh1ctRLA.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D chart on TradingView\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the sell volume is decreasing and the RSI is less than 20.

He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down. He sold part of Bitcoin and no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment method for no logical reason.\r\n\r\n\u003E Before we continue, I invite you to blow up the Upvote and Recommend buttons to help more people read this article.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet, Elon Musk said that Bitcoin uses electric energy for mining coming from fossil fuels, which doesn’t match with Tesla’s green energy philosophy. Come on!\r\n\r\nElon Musk is the man who created Paypal, sends rockets to Mars, and triggers the E.V. boom. He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though. A genius like him must have a plan. Or he may just like having fun with his influence.\r\n\r\n\u003E With great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the lessons from this experience are:\r\n\r\n-   listen to influencers with a grain of salt;\r\n-   crypto is prone to (psychological) manipulation, which makes it far from adoptable.\r\n\r\n# Bear market already?\r\n\r\nIf we go below the 200-day EMA, most probably.

Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities. The assets were chosen randomly, so I don’t invite you to invest in any of them.\r\n\r\nIn every screenshot, I included the average winning to losing trades ratio so you can see we have more than 2 times more winning compared to losing trades (ratio \u003E 2).\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
