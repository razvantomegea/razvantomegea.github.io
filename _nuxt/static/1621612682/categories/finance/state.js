He has been tweeting about Bitcoin and Dogecoin making them dump and pump in price.\r\n\r\nAfter publicly saying Tesla will accept Bitcoin as a payment method and buying 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, he then flipped upside down. He sold part of Bitcoin and no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment method for no logical reason.\r\n\r\n\u003E Before we continue, I invite you to blow up the Upvote and Recommend buttons to help more people read this article.\r\n\r\nIn a tweet, Elon Musk said that Bitcoin uses electric energy for mining coming from fossil fuels, which doesn’t match with Tesla’s green energy philosophy. Come on!\r\n\r\nElon Musk is the man who created Paypal, sends rockets to Mars, and triggers the E.V. boom. He knows much more than he wants to show on Twitter.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Bitcoin and the crypto market went down 20% after Elon Musk’s tweets because of panic. Why people? Why be a sheep?\r\n\r\nThis proved to me how many gamblers are in the crypto market.\r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t sell anything. I don’t understand what the big plan of Elon Musk is though. A genius like him must have a plan. Or he may just like having fun with his influence.\r\n\r\n\u003E With great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the lessons from this experience are:\r\n\r\n-   listen to influencers with a grain of salt;\r\n-   crypto is prone to (psychological) manipulation, which makes it far from adoptable.\r\n\r\n# Bear market already?\r\n\r\nIf we go below the 200-day EMA, most probably.

Everything is at least 3x since last year. You look at the charts and you can’t believe your eyes. If you invested 1 year ago, now you were rich.\r\n\r\nYou finally grew some and decided to put some money in your favorite crypto. Should you now? I am happy you decided to read this article because it will save you a lot of money.\r\n\r\nBesides the great technology behind it, crypto is great because it can make you huge profits in a short period. The same profits would take years or even decades to achieve in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same way you make gains, you can also make losses if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling).\r\n\r\n\u003E Just because the charts go to the moon doesn’t mean you should buy.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake, it is tempting, but don’t do it. This is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), when you’re knees are shaking and want to enter a parabolic trend.\r\n\r\nSo, everything is nearly parabolic now. Should you start investing now? The answer is it depends.\r\n\r\nSide note, I love the answer “it depends”. It makes everybody seem smart and interesting even though they know nearly shit about the topic. It also fits well with every question.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the part that I made myself an amateur, which I am, it depends if you want to invest now in crypto.\r\n\r\n### What are your expectations?\r\n\r\nIf you want to 10x your investment in a month, please leave investing for other people. You better go buy lottery tickets. It is very possible, but the chances are very low, and the risks very high.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any investment at any time. Investing is for patient people. You know why? Because no trend goes only. Corrections and crashes come regularly and if you are not patient, you will panic-sell.\r\n\r\nAfter you panic-sold, Murphy’s law punches you in the face and the chart bounces back. If you were patient, you would have known that profits will come.\r\n\r\n### How much do you plan to hold?\r\n\r\nIf you plan to hold for a few months, then no. Stay away for now. We will have either a big correction in autumn, either the bear market will begin in autumn. Nothing is for sure, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCrypto goes in 4-year cycles. The next bull market will be in 4 years when most crypto assets will be doubled in value from what we have now. Thus, **if you plan to buy and hold (Hodl!) for at least 4 years, you can invest whenever you want.**\r\n\r\n### How much are you willing to invest and lose?\r\n\r\nNever invest the money you need in the next 6 months. Unless you like being stressed and making emotional (bad) decisions. Always invest the money you don’t even notice is missing.\r\n\r\nI made this mistake and it made me stressed as fuck; I kept looking on the charts 10–20 times per day. This is not healthy and wise. Crypto is very volatile and looking at the portfolio and charts more than once per day is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nCrypto is in its early stages and has a lot of room to grow. It is similar to what Web 1.0 was in the early 90s. Crypto and blockchain will revolutionize finance and the entire digital world.\r\n\r\n**_If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

You probably learned the basics; if not, I encourage you to watch some [YouTube videos](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fresults?search_query=coin+bureau+technical+analysis), take some [courses](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade), or read a [book](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCharting-Technical-Analysis-Fred-McAllen-ebook\u002Fdp\u002FB007PRECN2\u002Fref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1620459299&sr=8-1) on this topic. I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.

Just because it is available on a DEX like Uniswap doesn’t mean you should swap your money for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, each stock has some fundamentals that can be analyzed and help you better understand if the stock (company) is worth investing in (e.g. financials, niche, CEO, vision, etc.).\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies also have  some fundamentals that can be analyzed. If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmarketcap.com\u002F). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.intotheblock.com\u002F)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cryptoratingcouncil.com\u002Fasset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Fbitcoin-rainbow-chart\u002F). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002F)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I choose crypto assets in the top 50 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n2.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n3.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n4.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n5.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n6.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n7.  I make sure the assets have high volume;\r\n8.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n10.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

Why? Because of these two laws of the stock market.\r\n\r\nTrading relies on technical analysis to predict the market. 90% of traders who rely on technical analysis lose money, according to  [Bill Williams](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=bNxt298VVOw&list=PLp9LyEgIX9p8UqlZnVAcKnOeRwSxOM6B6).\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Wolf Of Wallstreet? The character played by Matthew McConaughey said:\r\n\r\n\u003E “No one can predict if the stock market is going up, down, sideways, or in frickin circles.”\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the 10% traders who makes profit long term, good for you. For me and the other 90% of traders doesn’t work. So what should we do instead? We should cleverly invest long-term.\r\n\r\nWe should research in advance of any investment initially. Afterward, we must buy and hold for at least 3–5 years. We must also periodically analyze each investment to be sure it is still a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhy hold for years? Here’s why:\r\n\r\n# 1. The stock market will always crash\r\n\r\nWe have seen through time that recessions occur. It is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Unfortunately, we can never predict when a stock market will crash.\r\n\r\nJust look at the stock and real estate market now during the pandemic. The government prints trillions of dollars and euros, unemployment is going up, money does no longer circulate because people stay at home, but the stock and real market are going up.\r\n\r\nCheck this video from Ray Dalio on  [How the economy works](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s). He explains how the economy works and why we are in a new great depression.\r\n\r\nRecessions occur every few decades that cause the stock market to crash and come back only after 3–5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the reason for holding for at least 3–5 years. In case of a crash, the market will have time to bounce back, and you won’t be at a loss.\r\n\r\n# 2. The market will always come back\r\n\r\nThe S&P, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have always crashed but always came back stronger than ever. By the way, check my article on the  [S&P 500](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fthe-capital\u002Fthe-lowest-risk-time-proof-investment-everyone-should-choose-d22d5c9cfe56).\r\n\r\nIf we look at the historical charts of good stocks and indexes, they always had periods of lows, but then came back higher than ever. We need to accepts that crashes and bubbles are commonalities of the stock market.\r\n\r\nEven the crypto markets have periods of going up, crashing, then coming back stronger than ever. For crypto, these periods come every four years during halvings. It means 2021 is a bull run for crypto, but this is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is to stop listening to experts who say to buy now, sell now, go short, go long, or whatever. Now you know that you can’t predict asset movements based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can predict if an asset goes up long term based on scientific research. What you can’t predict is short temporary moves based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\n# How to apply this knowledge?\r\n\r\n1.  Research an asset to find if it has the potential to grow;\r\n2.  Buy and asset if not overvalued. Don’t emotionally buy because of fear of missing out based on hype (FOMO). For instance, don’t buy Tesla now;\r\n3.  During market crashes, buy more, don’t sell. You can use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to periodically buy small amounts than to buy high amounts at once;\r\n4.  Hold it for at least three years, and re-analyze annually your investment (is it still a good investment?);\r\n5.  Sell if the investment has run its course.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
