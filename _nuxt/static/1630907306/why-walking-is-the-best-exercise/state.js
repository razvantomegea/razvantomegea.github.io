I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n## Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n## No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n## Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n## Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n## Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.
