However, the process is not as easy as said. Some people obtain a caloric deficit naturally by feeling full very fast with few calories.\n\nI need a lot of food to feel satisfied (~1kg). Of course, I can try to eat slower, have smaller portions, eat more often, but that is not my thing. The truth is, **I love to eat a lot of food**.\n\nIf you feel me, you are probably like me. Fortunately, I managed to come with a recipe for staying fit while also eating a lot of food and not counting calories.\n\nThe recipe can be applied **anywhere, anytime, and for free**. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n### 1. Eliminate fat sources\n\n**Oil, butter, margarine, animal fat, nuts, seeds,** and anything containing them. In other words, (I) eat foods low in fat or without fat at all. The only **exception is fatty cold-water fish** which has the EPAs and DHAs (omega-3s).\n\nWe do not require that much fat because **our body is very good at producing fat on its own; the same story for sugars**.\n\nWe need to provide food high in essential nutrients: **water, protein** (some amino acids), **omega-3s** from cold-water fatty fish (omega-6s we have enough), **vitamins, minerals, and fiber** (a bit debatable).\n\nThus, foods high in water, protein, omega-3s, vitamins, minerals, and fiber are **vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products (+ fatty cold-water fish)**.\n\nOf course, you can also eat bread, rice, pasta, corn, or legumes on the side. You can also **enjoy once per week some pizza or something out of the rules**. I like to eat shawarma on Sundays and some cookies from time to time.\n\nYou should listen to your body if you have cravings, but do not overdo it. If you crave potato chips or french fries every day, we have a problem. You may not have cravings but bad habits.\n\n### 2. Don’t drink your calories\n\nThe next time you drink three beers or a Starbucks combo, think again. These two may be worth 500 kcalories, equivalent to a meal.\n\n**Beer, cocktails, soda, coffee with cream, energy drinks, fruit juices, and sugary drinks** must be avoided or kept only for one day per week.\n\nThe idea is simple: **fluid calories don’t make you full but make you crave them more**.\n\nI drink only **water, black coffee, non-calorie sweetened\u002Funsweetened tea, and low-calorie alcoholic drinks** (dry wine, tequila, brandy).\n\nIf you like sodas, substitute them with zero-calorie versions. They may not be healthier but will help you for sure keep away the fat.\n\n### 3. Walk as your life depends on it\n\nI walk **8000–15000 steps per day,** equivalent to 350–700kcal. **Walking is independent of weather, equipment, time, and location**. Your only excuse is comfort or a health condition (I am deeply sorry if that is the case).\n\nI wrote an article on walking which you can check [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4).\n\nAre you traveling? You can walk and visit. Are you working? You can go to work and back on foot. You can go shopping on foot when you don’t have too much to buy.\n\nYou can put some audiobooks or listen to podcasts while walking. It’s the most versatile exercise one can do. You also don’t need recovery from walking. If you’re in a hurry or want to boost the cardio benefits, you can increase the pace or elevation.\n\nThese are my three rules for staying lean without trying. I hope you found them useful, and I invite you to leave a comment with your tricks on how to stay lean."}]}],["articles\u002FREAD_ARTICLE",{type:"READ_ARTICLE",id:a}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:b}]]}}("develop-these-3-simple-habits-and-youll-be-fit-for-life","Develop These 3 Simple Habits And You'll Be Fit For Life")));
