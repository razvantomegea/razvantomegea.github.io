If you’re not new to my articles, you know I am repeating the statement above in every fitness article.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember the calorie equation to avoid being fooled by the latest diet or supplement. However, it is not that easy to achieve a caloric deficit as it is on paper.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will provide two hacks that helped me achieve a caloric deficit in the background.\r\n\r\n## Turn off the TV\r\n\r\nWatching movies or videos while eating distracts you from your body’s signals. You may end up eating mindlessly, even after being full. Turn off the TV, PC, phone, or any other media device when your eating.\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes on your plate and be more mindful of your body. Don’t eat until you are stuffed, but until you are satisfied. Avoiding electronics will help you better understand the difference between satisfied and stuffed.\r\n\r\n## Slow down\r\n\r\nIt [takes 20 minutes for our hunger hormones (CCK and leptin) to stabilize and make us no longer feel hungry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fwhy-eating-slowly-may-help-you-feel-full-faster-20101019605). If you are eating in a rush, you will eat more food than you probably need in one seating.\r\n\r\nTake your time and enjoy your food. Look at eating like a meditation; an opportunity to relax and be with your own thoughts. If you are eating with your friends or family, it is a good opportunity to connect and socialize. Socializing while eating may help you slow down.\r\n\r\n## Use small plates\r\n\r\nPutting the same portion size on a small plate instead of a large plate creates the illusion of more food. It may help you eat less because you think you are eating more than you need.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is you may out less food in front of you. We usually overeat when we put too much food on the table because it just stands there in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
