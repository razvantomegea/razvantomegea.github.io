Do you have something you need to accomplish, but you can seem to put yourself to do the work? Is it an exam, a project, or just the usual daily chores?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis delaying of duties is called procrastination. Funny enough, we are still procrastinating even though we know we still need to do it in the future. How can this happen? How can we fool ourselves in avoiding the inevitable?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is something deep down in our human nature.\r\n\r\n# Energy preservation\r\n\r\nFor millions of years, human beings have been fighting with survival. Food was not always at our disposal like today, and we didn't have the privilege to access anything at just one click distance.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack then, everything required our energy. Our energy was critical, and we needed to be careful with how we spent it. Thus, **we are programmed to preserve our energy** as much as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccomplishing tasks requires both physical and mental energy. Our conservatory body, especially our brain, is fighting to avoid any energy waste. It is why we find it so hard to put ourselves to work. **Our body has programmed us to be lazy.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are tricks to fool our brains into doing the work.\r\n\r\n# Focus on the first step\r\n\r\nUsually, when we try to convince ourselves to do tasks, **we think of the entire process at once**. If we have more than one thing to do, we think of all of them at once and try to calculate every step in our minds.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe process of analyzing every step in our minds becomes overwhelming. I don't know about you, but for me, it is stressful and makes me anxious.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I found is that **if I focus only on the first step, then everything flows on its own.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is always the hardest because it is the one step that makes us get into the zone.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhenever I want to write some code, and I don't feel like it, I trick myself by saying: \"I will just sit at the desk, open the programming tool and write one line of code.\" Hours pass by, and one line becomes 100 lines.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther tasks that were hard for me in the past now have become routines that I do on autopilot. Tasks like exercising, cooking, shopping, laundry, etc. are now automatic and don't require any mental energy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, whatever you need to do, focus only on the first step. If you need to study, just set the goal to sit down and open the book. If you need to do your homework, focus on sitting at your desk, and doing one exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can also look at it like this: **you know you will do it sometime, so why avoid the inevitable?**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in school, I liked to do my homework on Friday, because then I knew my entire weekend would be free and be relaxed. On the other hand, if I let my work for the last moment, then my mind would be only there, and wouldn't have enjoyed my free time to the fullest.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, if you accept that **there is no escaping from what you need to do**, you will do it anyway. What you can do is enjoying the process and make it fun. If you have a lot of time to accomplish it, **start early, and set small goals every day**. For instance, in college, I started studying since the first week and set myself the goal to read one page per day. It was easy for me to accomplish that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe have become a comfortable society that avoids discomfort and seeks constant pleasure. The living organism was designed to grow (evolve) only in acute stress (pain). It is why muscles grow after stressing them.\r\n\r\nThe only way to achieve growth is by **accepting pain as something natural and beneficial in our lives.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   focus on the first task, not the entire job at once;\r\n-   develop routines and do tasks automatically without thinking;\r\n-   stop running from the inevitable;\r\n-   accept pain as a natural and beneficial part of life.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
