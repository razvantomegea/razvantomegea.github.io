I guess I am similar to my father on this side. If someone ever told me to do something with an authoritative tone, I would do precisely the opposite. Even if I intended to do that exact requested thing, I would still not do it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, people hate smart guys. People don't like being told what to do, especially with the wrong tone. It is in our human nature that we chase some validation. However, when someone gives a piece of advice, we, most of the time, get offensive.\r\n\r\nIt is the ego that is trying to protect our self-esteem. It is the ego that makes us feel entitled.\r\n\r\nI remember that when I was a kid, my grandparents used o tell me to dress up to avoid catching a cold. \"Son, you will fill this when you get older.\" You know what a child response to that? \"Yeah, right! I will be fine! It won't happen to me.\" Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nOf most people, children hate being told what to do. They do the opposite of what rules are saying.\r\n\r\nHow can we then teach children and other people something good for themselves without being offended?\r\n\r\n# Mirror neurons\r\n\r\nMirror neurons are specialized neurons that trigger the same actions (impulses) observed in another subject. They make us **copy an observed activity**.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you go to the gym or see somebody working out, you suddenly feel like doing the same thing. You get into the zone or groove. This copying of state is the effect o mirror neurons firing.\r\n\r\nIf I think about it, when I was a child, I used to copy everything my father did. Unfortunately, I copied some bad habits too, like smoking and drinking - I quit early, no worries. My father was an example for me.\r\n\r\nMy father knew I was smoking, yet he never told me to quit smoking because he couldn't. He was also smoking and couldn't stop, so how could he ask me to do what he never could?\r\n\r\nYou see, we cannot force people to change just because we think it is the right thing to do, especially when we cannot do it ourselves. It would be selfish and hypocritical of us. What we can and should do is to **be an example.**\r\n\r\nMahatma Gandhi was right: **\"be the change you want to see in the world.\"**\r\n\r\nWe first need to change ourselves. I want young people to take better care of their health, so I am taking very care of myself. I want people to see what being healthy looks and feels. In the end, it should be their choice. Who knows, maybe some people like being sick.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have to make people aware of some facts, but it should be done friendly, with a soft tone, and only after we have already done it. Afterward, it is their responsibility and choice to change. We need to inspire through example (action) and give advice (help) only when asked.\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
