I am just a regular guy who **made a lot of mistakes and lost tons of money**.\n\nI like to experiment a lot in life and try everything, so I am privileged to say I have some **experience in what not to do**.\n\nI have been experimenting with cryptocurrencies, the stock market, commodities, and forex since 2018 when the crypto crash hit me like a wrecking ball. Afterward, leverage trading on the other assets hit me like an asteroid.\n\nHuman beings and animals learn through pain, and that’s a fact. It is because our **brain learns faster through emotional impact**, be it positive or negative.\n\nThus, is it **not enough for someone to tell us not to do something**. Until that person feels it on her own, she won’t trust the advice. However, it is my responsibility to share my experience, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nYou can read my trading and investing mistakes [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fbeginner-trading-mistakes-that-cost-me-dearly-avoid-these-5-amateur-mistakes-83543c59ae16).\n\nI tried to create trading algorithms and software to automate the process. I tried to analyze patterns and backtest every strategy. **On paper, everything looked beyond my wildest dreams**.\n\nYou can see some of my backtested strategies [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fthe-only-3-technical-analysis-tools-youll-ever-need-to-increase-your-profits-5b163453cc04) and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fthe-only-technical-indicator-you-need-to-make-outrageous-profits-6f1bf2bed321).\n\nHowever, when I started applying the strategies, something went wrong. I **started losing money**, not making money. I was so confused and disappointed. I thought I was not patient enough or too diversified. It may be true.\n\nEven with the emotional factor outside the game, it still didn’t work. Then I realized I must stop overcalculating and overanalyzing and keep it simple.\n\n### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)\n\nDCA is an investing strategy the implies **buying an asset at regular intervals**. Be it daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or even yearly.\n\nBetween these intervals, I found that monthly buying is the most profitable in the long run. You can use which one you please.\n\nBy using DCA in the long run, you **buy an asset at its average price**.\n\nOf course, a more profitable strategy is to buy and hold in the inception, but not everyone has a lot of capital at hand and spots opportunities. It is also riskier because you don’t know how it plays in the long run.\n\nThe main idea is **you can’t time the market.** Also, watching charts every day or every hour is time-consuming and makes you emotional and prone to bad decisions.\n\nWise people have used DCA for decades and always one. You can **substitute DCA with accumulation**. You want to accumulate more assets over time.\n\nThere is a caveat; you need to be **at least 75% certain the asset will grow over time**. You can’t DCA Shiba Ina or other meme coin or meme stock. Thus, you need to invest some time in the beginning to find a relatively safe asset.\n\nI choose to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Gold, and Silver. It’s my choice. I am not recommending, just sharing.\n\nLet’s see some examples of DCA profits in time.\n\n![Bitcoin $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2008 ($1.230.000 invested, $2.165.129.746 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*rFvRWfwHo-tKECKD2O2Sxw.png)\n\n\n![S&P 500 $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2000 ($1.750.000 invested, $3.575.903 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*NxOoM3tDGNww2KAO1z-UwA.png)\n\n\n![Gold $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2000 ($1.790.000 invested, $2.583.494 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*tvGJf4-DWctcgDd7SOFe8g.png)\n\n"};f[1]={id:"bitcoin-season-confirmed-$200000-in-2022",author:a,title:"Bitcoin Season Confirmed. $200.000 In 2022?",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2021",categories:c,description:"The Bull Market Was Not Over.",imageCredit:"Photo by André François McKenzie on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FJrjhtBJ-pGU",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fbitcoin-season-confirmed-$200000-in-2022.md"},markdown:"According to [the Blockchain center](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F), we are not in altcoin season, and of course, we are in Bitcoin season.\n\nWe can see this by looking at Bitcoin’s performance in the last two weeks (50% up). Now, Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time high and will most probably not stop here.\n\nAccording to [PlanB’s stock-to-flow model](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F), the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin this year is $78.000.

What we need to know and trust is that Bitcoin will go up in the next ten years. It will outperform any other relatively safe asset, like S&P 500 and Gold.\n\nOf course, if we are talking about Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Terra, they will outperform Bitcoin but with a higher risk.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

However, the process is not as easy as said. Some people obtain a caloric deficit naturally by feeling full very fast with few calories.\n\nI need a lot of food to feel satisfied (~1kg). Of course, I can try to eat slower, have smaller portions, eat more often, but that is not my thing. The truth is, **I love to eat a lot of food**.\n\nIf you feel me, you are probably like me. Fortunately, I managed to come with a recipe for staying fit while also eating a lot of food and not counting calories.\n\nThe recipe can be applied **anywhere, anytime, and for free**. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n### 1. Eliminate fat sources\n\n**Oil, butter, margarine, animal fat, nuts, seeds,** and anything containing them. In other words, (I) eat foods low in fat or without fat at all. The only **exception is fatty cold-water fish** which has the EPAs and DHAs (omega-3s).\n\nWe do not require that much fat because **our body is very good at producing fat on its own; the same story for sugars**.\n\nWe need to provide food high in essential nutrients: **water, protein** (some amino acids), **omega-3s** from cold-water fatty fish (omega-6s we have enough), **vitamins, minerals, and fiber** (a bit debatable).\n\nThus, foods high in water, protein, omega-3s, vitamins, minerals, and fiber are **vegetables, fruits, and lean animal products (+ fatty cold-water fish)**.\n\nOf course, you can also eat bread, rice, pasta, corn, or legumes on the side. You can also **enjoy once per week some pizza or something out of the rules**. I like to eat shawarma on Sundays and some cookies from time to time.\n\nYou should listen to your body if you have cravings, but do not overdo it. If you crave potato chips or french fries every day, we have a problem. You may not have cravings but bad habits.\n\n### 2. Don’t drink your calories\n\nThe next time you drink three beers or a Starbucks combo, think again. These two may be worth 500 kcalories, equivalent to a meal.\n\n**Beer, cocktails, soda, coffee with cream, energy drinks, fruit juices, and sugary drinks** must be avoided or kept only for one day per week.\n\nThe idea is simple: **fluid calories don’t make you full but make you crave them more**.\n\nI drink only **water, black coffee, non-calorie sweetened\u002Funsweetened tea, and low-calorie alcoholic drinks** (dry wine, tequila, brandy).\n\nIf you like sodas, substitute them with zero-calorie versions. They may not be healthier but will help you for sure keep away the fat.\n\n### 3. Walk as your life depends on it\n\nI walk **8000–15000 steps per day,** equivalent to 350–700kcal. **Walking is independent of weather, equipment, time, and location**. Your only excuse is comfort or a health condition (I am deeply sorry if that is the case).\n\nI wrote an article on walking which you can check [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4).\n\nAre you traveling? You can walk and visit. Are you working? You can go to work and back on foot. You can go shopping on foot when you don’t have too much to buy.\n\nYou can put some audiobooks or listen to podcasts while walking. It’s the most versatile exercise one can do. You also don’t need recovery from walking. If you’re in a hurry or want to boost the cardio benefits, you can increase the pace or elevation.\n\nThese are my three rules for staying lean without trying. I hope you found them useful, and I invite you to leave a comment with your tricks on how to stay lean."};f[3]={id:"can-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time",author:a,title:"Can You Really Build Muscle And Burn Fat At The Same Time?",createdOn:g,categories:b,description:"Is body recomposition real?",imageCredit:"Photo by Damir Spanic on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FCs73R4ZO50E",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fcan-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time.md"},markdown:"We all want to be lean and muscular — or at least toned. However, we are in a paradox because the two objectives require opposite approaches. At least, that is what the fitness industry says.\n\nYou know the bodybuilder cycle: bulking up during cold periods (off-season), then cutting during hot periods.\n\nIsn’t there another way to build muscle and stay lean at the same time? In other words, lean gains, body recomposition, and maingain? Of course, it is possible. We need to understand the physiology of fat loss and muscle growth.\n\n# How do muscles grow?\n\nMuscle growth is an adaptation to regular acute stress. When resistance is applied to the muscle, it will adapt to manage that resistance in the future in a more efficient manner.\n\nIt does this by strengthing the neuromuscular connections and by increasing the size or number of the muscle fibers.\n\nHowever, the adaptation requires some resources. These are protein, water, energy, and some other micronutrients that sustain the process. The neuromuscular adaptation happens during rest.\n\n# How do we burn body fat?\n\nBody fat is stored (excess) energy. When we consume more energy than we need, that energy is not wasted but stored for later when we’ll possibly need it.\n\nThus, to burn body fat, we need to be in a state of energy deficiency, so that the body can use the stored energy — caloric deficit.\n\nNow, let’s think about it. To build muscle, we need to apply resistance to the muscles by going to the gym, provide energy, protein, water, and micronutrients, and recover (sleep).\n\nTo burn body fat, we need to be in a caloric deficit.\n\nWhy can’t these two happen at the same time? Muscle growth requires energy which can come from the body fat. Thus, we can build muscle and burn fat at the same time.\n\nAn important note here. If you are already under 10% body fat, then a slight caloric surplus is in order. By slight, I don’t mean 500kcal\u002Fday, but 5–10% of your daily needs. If you need 3000kcal\u002Fday, then a 150–300kcal surplus per day is enough.\n\nHowever, most people are not under 10% body fat, so you can be in a slight caloric deficit, lift weights, and still see body recomposition happening.\n\nYou can also be at energy maintenance; your body fat will support the energy required by muscle growth.\n\nSo you see, by applying basic physiology, we can debunk the myths surrounding us in the fitness industry.\n\nAlso, body recomposition is the best goal for everyone because it implies making fitness a lifestyle and not a short-term thing like bulking and cutting do. You are fit year-round for life.\n\nOf course, bulking and cutting are part of a lifestyle, but why put your body through that much weight change when you can go steady in the long term?"};f[4]={id:"how-much-money-should-you-waste-on-a-car",author:a,title:"How Much Money Should You Waste On A Car",createdOn:"Sep 4, 2021",categories:c,description:"You will always lose money.",imageCredit:"Photo by Dhiva Krishna on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FX16zXcbxU4U",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fhow-much-money-should-you-waste-on-a-car.md"},markdown:"*Romanian video version [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=i3dzMOB73wc).*\n\nCars have become the manifestation of wealth. If a person owns a good-looking car or a specific brand, then that person is somebody important.\n\nHowever, many people don’t have enough money to from month to month, but they have an expensive car. It happens just so other people can validate them and increase their self-esteem.\n\nYes, people who show off with what they own are people with low self-esteem. So, before buying fancy cars, clothes, and jewelry to impress people, better focus on the root cause of this desire.\n\nA car is a tool to take you from point A to point B with a grade of comfort. Most cars cant take us here and there, but the comfort, looks, branding, and quality are different. For these four attributes, we pay the price.\n\nOf course, we all want a car that gives us a bit of comfort, especially if we travel by car a lot, and we want the car to be reliable. However, no matter the reliability, we will still need to invest in it like in a child.\n\nMake no mistake; a car is not an investment (asset) but a liability. For this reason, we need to choose it based on our income. Regardless we pick a fancy car if we don’t have the money to buy gas (or electricity) and maintain it.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to buy a car worth your four-month income. If your monthly income is $2000, you can afford an $8000 car. If your monthly income is $1000, you can afford a $4000 car.\n\nIt may sound too little, but it is the reality. Instead of wasting more money on a car, you would better focus on increasing your wealth by investing in assets: stocks, real estate, crypto, commodities.\n\nOr you can invest in yourself, develop new skills and get a better-paying job. The idea is to invest your money, not waste it on fancy stuff to fit in a fake society.\n"};f[5]={id:"stop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack",author:a,title:"Stop Doing This If You Want A Six-Pack",createdOn:g,categories:b,description:"Myth debunking.",imageCredit:"Photo by Jannes Jacobs on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FpMQgDg_8z88",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fstop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack.md"},markdown:"Everybody likes having a good-looking beach body, and this implies having a visible six-pack.

Look at “The Rock”; he is big and muscular but without a visible six-pack. Isn’t he fit? Of course, he is.\n\nAlso, for women is harder than for men to have a visible six-pack because of hormones.
