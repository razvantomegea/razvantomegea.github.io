I am just a regular guy who **made a lot of mistakes and lost tons of money**.\n\nI like to experiment a lot in life and try everything, so I am privileged to say I have some **experience in what not to do**.\n\nI have been experimenting with cryptocurrencies, the stock market, commodities, and forex since 2018 when the crypto crash hit me like a wrecking ball. Afterward, leverage trading on the other assets hit me like an asteroid.\n\nHuman beings and animals learn through pain, and that’s a fact. It is because our **brain learns faster through emotional impact**, be it positive or negative.\n\nThus, is it **not enough for someone to tell us not to do something**. Until that person feels it on her own, she won’t trust the advice. However, it is my responsibility to share my experience, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nYou can read my trading and investing mistakes [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fbeginner-trading-mistakes-that-cost-me-dearly-avoid-these-5-amateur-mistakes-83543c59ae16).\n\nI tried to create trading algorithms and software to automate the process. I tried to analyze patterns and backtest every strategy. **On paper, everything looked beyond my wildest dreams**.\n\nYou can see some of my backtested strategies [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fthe-only-3-technical-analysis-tools-youll-ever-need-to-increase-your-profits-5b163453cc04) and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcoinmonks\u002Fthe-only-technical-indicator-you-need-to-make-outrageous-profits-6f1bf2bed321).\n\nHowever, when I started applying the strategies, something went wrong. I **started losing money**, not making money. I was so confused and disappointed. I thought I was not patient enough or too diversified. It may be true.\n\nEven with the emotional factor outside the game, it still didn’t work. Then I realized I must stop overcalculating and overanalyzing and keep it simple.\n\n### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)\n\nDCA is an investing strategy the implies **buying an asset at regular intervals**. Be it daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or even yearly.\n\nBetween these intervals, I found that monthly buying is the most profitable in the long run. You can use which one you please.\n\nBy using DCA in the long run, you **buy an asset at its average price**.\n\nOf course, a more profitable strategy is to buy and hold in the inception, but not everyone has a lot of capital at hand and spots opportunities. It is also riskier because you don’t know how it plays in the long run.\n\nThe main idea is **you can’t time the market.** Also, watching charts every day or every hour is time-consuming and makes you emotional and prone to bad decisions.\n\nWise people have used DCA for decades and always one. You can **substitute DCA with accumulation**. You want to accumulate more assets over time.\n\nThere is a caveat; you need to be **at least 75% certain the asset will grow over time**. You can’t DCA Shiba Ina or other meme coin or meme stock. Thus, you need to invest some time in the beginning to find a relatively safe asset.\n\nI choose to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Gold, and Silver. It’s my choice. I am not recommending, just sharing.\n\nLet’s see some examples of DCA profits in time.\n\n![Bitcoin $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2008 ($1.230.000 invested, $2.165.129.746 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*rFvRWfwHo-tKECKD2O2Sxw.png)\n\n\n![S&P 500 $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2000 ($1.750.000 invested, $3.575.903 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*NxOoM3tDGNww2KAO1z-UwA.png)\n\n\n![Gold $10.000 Monthly DCA Since 2000 ($1.790.000 invested, $2.583.494 gain)](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*tvGJf4-DWctcgDd7SOFe8g.png)\n\n";f[0]=e;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1636463292",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:b,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:c},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:d,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:e,articles:f,searchQuery:a,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:f,isSearching:b}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fwhy-dca-is-the-best-investing-strategy-everyone-should-start-using-now",config:{}}}("",false,"Finance","Why DCA Is The Best Investing Strategy Everyone Should Start Using Now",{},Array(1)));
