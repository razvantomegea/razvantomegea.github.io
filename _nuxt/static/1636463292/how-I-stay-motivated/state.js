I life without meaning (or direction) is an empty life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, goals are not enough; **you must achieve your goals; otherwise, they are just fantasies** - dreams. The only way to achieve goals is by doing the work.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs simple as it sounds, **it is not easy at all**. The only thing that stays in our way to achieving anything in life is our ability to **decide to do work**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe biggest question is **how to decide** to do the work? In other words, **how to get motivated** to get to work? You might not like the answer: you don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**_Motivation is just a temporary and limited energy burst (feeling) that helps you to do the work._**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI cannot stress temporary and limited enough. Here's the thing, \"I achieved everything because I was motivated every day of my life,\" said no successful person ever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**No one is motivated every single day of their life**. Every person would rather stay in bed and scroll Instagram or Facebook 24\u002F7. It is so comfortable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSuccessful people **decide** to do the work and **accept** it is the right thing to do. In the beginning, it is very hard, but in the long term, it becomes **automatic - a routine**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is the secret to progress in any area. **Create routines** so that you no longer need to think to do something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, eating healthily, exercising, cooking, working on my projects, waking without an alarm clock have become automatic. I've been doing them for so long, they have become something natural and fun to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you may ask: how to be motivated in the beginning, before creating a routine?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI will reveal two secrets:\r\n\r\n1.  **_Motivation is a tank that is full in the morning and empty in the evening;_**\r\n2.  **_Focus on long-term fulfillment and happiness than on short-term pleasures._**\r\n\r\nThese are the two secrets that helped me achieve anything.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always do the most important and most challenging things first thing in the morning because I am most motivated then.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always think of: \"How proud would I be of myself in the future if I looked back and saw myself choosing work instead of procrastination?\". I also hate the guilt and frustration after not doing what I need to do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI can reframe everything in a single sentence: **do the difficult and disgusting things now; relax and enjoy later.** It is my main principle and philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***";f[0]=e;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1636463292",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:b,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:c},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:d,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:e,articles:f,searchQuery:a,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:f,isSearching:b}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fhow-I-stay-motivated",config:{}}}("",false,"Self-development","How I Stay Motivated",{},Array(1)));
