Now, Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time high and will most probably not stop here.\n\nAccording to [PlanB’s stock-to-flow model](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F), the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin this year is $78.000. PlanB’s predictions have been damn right until now.\n\nLooking at the previous bull markets from 2013 and 2017, Bitcoin reached ten times and five times, respectively, the stock-to-flow model ($1.180 instead of $166 and $20.000 instead of $4000).\n\nIf we follow the same pattern for this bull market, Bitcoin should have a 2.5 times higher price than the stock-to-flow model, which is 200.000 (ten times than previous bull market peak), the most optimistic price for this bull market.\n\nRest assured that we will see two or three corrections until we reach the highest price for this bull market.\n\nBitcoin going to $1.000.000 will happen in 8 years, a.k.a. in the following two bull markets.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what price Bitcoin will reach. What we need to know and trust is that Bitcoin will go up in the next ten years. It will outperform any other relatively safe asset, like S&P 500 and Gold.\n\nOf course, if we are talking about Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Terra, they will outperform Bitcoin but with a higher risk.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
