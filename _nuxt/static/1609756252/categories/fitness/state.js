I hoped they would help me achieve my fitness goals faster and easier. Many people dream of a pill that could help them lose weight or build muscle with less effort.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe read the news and see some supplements based on \"research studies.\" \"Research says that [name the supplement] may be effective for [name the effect].\" Seems familiar?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because a research paper concluded that something is effective doesn't mean that something is good. Few people can read a research paper and understand it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlso, notice that most say \"it may,\" which means that it is possible, not for sure. It looks like we're playing Russian roulette with our money and bodies. I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[1]={id:"why-walking-is-the-best-exercise",author:a,title:"Why Walking Is The Best Exercise",createdOn:"Oct 20, 2020",categories:b,description:"I am a big fan of walking.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n### Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n### No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n### Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n### Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n### Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FThe-Science-of-Nutrition\u002Fdp\u002F0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.

We cannot predict 100% how much calories we consume and burn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt becomes less trivial when we are not home eating our prepared foods or when we don't have the time and information and track everything.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is to be aware of what foods have the least calories and which have the most.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong all foods, these two food groups have prevented me from being in shape and, for sure, millions more.\r\n\r\n# Fats & Oils\r\n\r\nFats and oils are the highest calorie foods on the planet because they are pure fat and have ~900kcal per 100g. Fats and oils are in sauces, chips, dressings, fried foods, cakes, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if it's coconut oil, olive oil, or whatever healthy oil you may find: it is still fattening. If you are cooking and need some fat, use a cooking spray; it prevents you from adding too much fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAvoid fats and oils and foods containing them in high amounts as much as possible. You can easily tell which foods contain these ingredients only by looking at them or reading the label.\r\n\r\n# Nuts & Seeds\r\n\r\nAfter fats and oils, nuts and seeds are the second-worst foods to consume if you are trying to burn some fat. Nuts and seeds are ~60% fat and have around 600kcal per 100g. Not only that, but they are low in volume and highly palatable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a blink of an eye, you finished a bag of cashews, pistachios, or pumpkin seeds of 1000kcal, and you are still hungry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like snacking when watching a game or movie, try something low in fat like popcorn (without butter) or fat-free chips. If you are drinking, you shouldn't be snacking in the first place, as alcohol increases your appetite.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you cannot quit nuts and seeds, choose the ones in the shell and don't eat more than one fist.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[3]={id:"is-a-six-pack-worth-it",author:a,title:"Is A Six-Pack Worth It?

It is easy when you're living alone and isolated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI've isolated myself for five years to focus on my career, health, and fitness, and it has cost me dearly. I've lost my social skills, and I can come as anti-social. I am not anti-social, not anymore at least, but I have a little social anxiety. If I think about it, I am causing my discomfort because I don't have my food, and I am not in my habitat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy obsessions with being fit all the time prevent me from having fun and feeling good from time to time on weekends. As hard as I am trying to hide this, people can tell, and it is not cool.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, because of my trauma from childhood when I was overweight, I have come to believe that only if I were to be fit could I be accepted in society. It sucks how some childhood trauma can affect your entire life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to make a balance between social life and my goals through portion control. If we think about it, if I eat correctly five-six days per week, on day of cheating won't do any harm if done correctly. I know that fatty foods are the enemy, so I always eat the slimmest food on the table. When it comes to alcohol, I also choose low-calorie alcohol drinks and avoid soft drinks (I don't like them).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf anything slim or low calorie is available, I consume small, minimal, portions, just enough to not be impolite, because that's what is all about.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go off-road from your plan a day per week, but then you are back on track the following six days, it is perfect. **If the long-term trend is up, it doesn't matter if, from time to time, there are some short-term downtrends**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the end, we are social beings, and **we cannot sacrifice our social life for anything in the world. It doesn't matter if you are rich, famous, fit, and good looking if you are alone and have no one with whom to share your success and happiness.** With patience and dedication, we can balance everything. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[4]={id:"health-and-fitness-myths",author:a,title:"Health And Fitness Myths You’re Probably Believing",createdOn:"Sep 29, 2020",categories:b,description:"The main reason I started this blog is to deliver unbiased, quality information from different aspects of our lives.

I like to **question everything and think outside the box**, and I invite you to take this as an example.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in a student, **teachers taught 20th-century technology and knowledge**. My girlfriend is a medical student, and she approves that medicine professors teach 20th-century medicine as well.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMost professors and PhDs stop researching and reading the latest discoveries in science, so they rely on old studies and knowledge. Not to say that **most of the research studies are biased or read incorrectly.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy point is, **don't take everything for granted**, even from professionals. Question everything, and do your research.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's see some common myths in health and fitness that are wrong.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Cholesterol in eggs is bad\r\n\r\nEggs yolks contain cholesterol, and high blood cholesterol damages the heart. Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCholesterol is **required to help the body synthesize vitamin D and testosterone.** Cholesterol may come from food or can be synthesized by the liver.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because we eat something, high cholesterol doesn't mean we will have high blood cholesterol. There are people with low cholesterol diets that have high triglycerides because they eat a lot of sugar. Also, having **high total blood cholesterol is not bad.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat we call blood cholesterol are lipoproteins of different densities and triglycerides. If you ever did a blood cholesterol test, you probably saw: LDL (and VLDL), HDL, triglycerides, and total lipids. From these numbers, **all that matters is the HDL ratio to the rest of the lipids**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe higher the HDL and the lower the LDL + triglycerides, the healthier you are. Total blood cholesterol is irrelevant. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you with cholesterol tracking and numbering.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen we consume good quality eggs with the yolk, both our HDL and LDL may rise in harmony. Eggs also have amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. They are the perfect food unless you have an allergy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, check Dr. Joseph Mercola's and Chris Kresser's articles ([this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.huffpost.com\u002Fentry\u002Fthe-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKm1it8M9nlsjkhKEVN3T8tq2lwVxTh-4yIpIQftbyHkAKS6MekYGz9KnZOG1qLkH7NW7ozbHbqnXRgnr3pp9z4gUfgNddtLMPnRkixnAfvE0zhkhqel8feSfxoXAuPMTx1NNViz1J757oZCm5br8Qw-mAky4h7VxtMgNSu77JSS&guccounter=2), [this](https:\u002F\u002Fchriskresser.com\u002Fthree-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away\u002F), and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mercola.com\u002Finfographics\u002Fcholesterol-levels.htm)).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Spot reduction\r\n\r\nDo crunches, and you'll lose belly fat. Do squats or lunges, and you'll lose fat from the legs. Unfortunately, we cannot force our bodies to burn fat from where we want. **The place we accumulate body fat is dictated by our genes and by our hormones**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only way to **lose body fat from all the places is through a** [**calorie (energy) deficit**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fdo-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Eating at night makes you fat.\r\n\r\nDon't eat after six o'clock, that's what they say. Wrong!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter when you eat. If your goal is to lose body fat, your only focus should be low calories and high satiety (high protein, fiber, and water). When you eat or how you spread your meals is your choice. If you are always full and in a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat without even trying.\r\n\r\n# Myth: 8 hours of sleep at night\r\n\r\nHow much sleep we need is **dictated by our age, gender, lifestyle, and genetics**. We are not the same, and general recommendations will never work. Some people can are fresh in 6 hours, other in 10.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMore important than sleep quantity is sleep quality. If you sleep 6 hours and are ready to move mountains, you're good to go. **Always listen to your body**, not to medical professionals. [My app](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F) will help you track your sleep and tell you about your sleep quality.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fast-food makes you fat.\r\n\r\n**No food makes you fat as well as no food makes you lose fat**. If you're eating only from fast-food but are in a calorie deficit, you'll lose fat. Also, if you eat only non-processed, non-GMO, organic, Saint, purified, energized, heavenly food but are in a calorie surplus, you'll gain fat. It is Isaac Newton science.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Alcohol makes you fat\r\n\r\nAlcohol can make you fat if you are eating afterward or while drinking. **Alcohol dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, the satiety and hunger hormones, and causes you to eat more.** If you also drink beer, which has a lot of calories, you'll gain fat for sure if you're in a calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to drink, do not overdo it, choose low-calorie drinks, and eat only before. I drink at a maximum of 1 bottle of dry wine per week, if not per month.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fruit makes you fat because of fructose\r\n\r\nIt is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. How can you say watermelon, which has 30kcal per 100g, makes you fat. I ate this summer 1kg of watermelon per day and lost body fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like how Greg Doucette said: \"I am sure people are overweight and obese because they are eating to much fruit.\" It still makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain and for the last time, **excess calories and only calories make you gain body fat**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   egg yolks are healthy, and you can eat as much as you like, as long as you don't abuse (3-5\u002Fday is ok);\r\n-   genetics and hormones dictate where you store fat;\r\n-   genetics, age, gender, and lifestyle dictate how much sleep you need;\r\n-   alcohol makes you fat indirectly by making you eat more;\r\n-   no food and drink cause weight loss or weight gain directly, only calories.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n***Want more Q&As or myths debunked?

Thus, I choose to look fit like an athlete at the expense of not looking so big.\r\n\r\n# Strength training 3x per week\r\n\r\nI do a full-body strength training three times per week. You may think this is for beginners, but it is not. The legendary bodybuilder Reg Park and Steve Reeves (and other old-school bodybuilders) were fans of this style of training. They were big, lean, and natural.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI did for a while upper-lower slipt and push-pull-legs split, but this is the one I enjoy doing the most. **When I do multiple exercises per muscle group in a single session, I feel I can't push at the maximum at each muscle group exercise.** It makes sense if you train as hard as you can at the first exercise, you then exhaust the muscle and won't give it your all at the following.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy legs are the biggest victims. After I do heavy squats or Bulgarian split squats, I can't walk; my legs are shaking. I would be exhausted if I were to do 2-3 leg exercises in one session.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI think if you train correctly and intensely, you need less time in the gym. The muscle needs stimulus to grow, not destruction. Your **muscles don't grow in the gym, but during recovery**, if you provide them all nutrients.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnother important point I want to make is I focus on **compound movements, using only bodyweight, free weight, and pulley** based exercises. I feel they engage me the most and have a functional implication on the body.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at my workouts, shall we?\r\n\r\n## Workout #1 Monday:\r\n\r\n-   Bench press;\r\n-   Weighed pull-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Arnold press;\r\n-   Lying triceps extensions;\r\n-   E-Z Bar barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #2 Wednesday:\r\n\r\n-   Incline dumbbell press;\r\n-   Barbell rows;\r\n-   Military press;\r\n-   Rope triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Dumbbell curls;\r\n-   Bulgarian split squats;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #3 Friday:\r\n\r\n-   Weighed dips;\r\n-   Weighed chin-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Lateral raises + rear delts superset;\r\n-   Triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the big muscle group exercises, I do **one warm-up set of 10-15 reps, and four working sets of 3-6 reps with the same weight**. When I can do six reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the small muscle group exercises, I do **four working sets of 5-8 reps**. When I can do eight reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne important note: I have **2-minute breaks between sets**, I **don't cheat**, and I **focus**  **on slow eccentric (negative)**. I do a 1-2 second concentric, 1-second isometric, and 3-4 second eccentric. The negative movement of the exercise has a higher impact on muscle growth than the positive one (check out [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.marksdailyapple.com\u002Fwhy-you-should-lift-and-lower-heavy-things\u002F)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, my workout routine allows me to recover between sessions. **When doing a high-intensity workout, your muscles are not the only ones exhausted, but your nervous system as well**. The nervous system doesn't have time to recover if one is doing a heavy high-intensity workout on consecutive days.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't do direct exercise on calves, forearms, and traps because they are worked indirectly by the compound movements.\r\n\r\n# Walking\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the days, I like to take long walks. Walking has no demand on the nervous system and even **helps with recovery**; not to mention that it **burns a lot of calories**. If you walk 12km, which is about 15.000 steps, you burn 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about walking is that you can do it anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I do full-body workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday;\r\n-   I do only compound movements;\r\n-   I do five sets for the big muscle group exercises, and four sets for the small ones;\r\n-   I focus on slow negatives (3-4 seconds) and correct form;\r\n-   I take 2-minute breaks between sets;\r\n-   I take long walks (12-15km) in the days off.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[6]={id:"healthy-food-that-make-you-gain-weight",author:a,title:"Healthy Food That Make You Gain Weight",createdOn:"Sep 23, 2020",categories:b,description:"There is a big misconception that if you need to lose body fat, you need to eat healthily.

It is why there is so much garbage fitness food out there that I am also consuming, like artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other chemicals. Yes, because being 100% healthy and 100% fit is not achievable for me at the same time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; there is garbage food everywhere. Everything is polluted and filled with chemicals and preservatives.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of so-called health foods that are calorie-dense (high calories per 100g). Let's see some common ones.\r\n\r\n# Cheese\r\n\r\nEverybody loves cheese, even people with lactose intolerance. I love cheese, but we need to learn to love what is good for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are many kinds of cheese, and I am not talking about low-fat cottage cheese, a great low-calorie, high-protein food. I am talking about the full-fat cheese, like cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick, and other matured high fat cheese.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey are very healthy and delicious, as they contain beneficial bacteria (if from trusted sources). The issue is they have **300-400 kcal per 100g. It is a lot of calories**, compared to low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, which contain 70-80 kcal per 100g.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I can never eat 50-100g of whole cheese. I eat 200-300g, which is 1000kcal. Thus, I avoid it and stick to low-fat dairy.\r\n\r\n# Coconut oil\r\n\r\nI used to put coconut oil in almost anything for its miracle benefits. They say it contains a lot of MCT oil, which is used directly for energy and not stored as fat. I was a fool to believe it. Any oil is stored as fat if it leads to a daily calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, coconut oil is a better alternative to plant-seed oils as it doesn't oxidize so quickly and easily. However, you still need to pay attention to the quantities, as it is **900kcal per 100g** (100% fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRegardless if you're using coconut oil or any oil, use a spray. I spray my pan when frying anything. Don't just pour from the bottle. If you don't have a cooking spray, use a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n# Peanut\u002FAlmond\u002FCashew butter\r\n\r\nI was addicted to peanut butter, and since the day I quit eating it, I started losing fat without thinking about it. **Peanut butter has, indeed, 26g of protein per 100g and lots of minerals, but it comes with a price of 550 kcal - if 100% peanuts**. There are kinds of peanut butter with only 50% peanuts, and the rest is palm oil. Those may reach 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found that a better version of peanut butter is powdered peanut butter, which is half the calories and doubles the protein.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI quit consuming peanuts completely, however, because I noticed I have smelly gas after, and I think I don't tolerate them (the irony).\r\n\r\n# Nuts and Seeds\r\n\r\nYou know what they say, eat vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds for a healthy diet. I agree only with 40% of this recommendation. The only healthy foods on this planet that anyone can agree with are vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGrains, nuts, and seeds are **high in calories and high in antinutrients** (prevent nutrient absorption.)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like to drink beer and eat nuts and seeds along the side, no wonder you have a big belly. **Nuts and seeds have ~650kcal per 100g**. 100g of nuts and seeds is less than a handful.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to snack something when watching a movie or when socializing, **choose home-made (not microwaved) popcorn or popcorn without added fat**. It has only 350kcal per 100g, but 100g is a lot.\r\n\r\n# Granola and Muesli\r\n\r\nMy journey to eating healthy begun with eating muesli, which is cereal combined with dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. If you also add some milk, you can have 1000kcal in a single meal. Now, if I think about it, granola is not that healthy, as it may contain a lot of sugar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy breakfast on muesli and milk had 1500kcal and didn't keep me so full, as it is mainly carbs and sugar. When we eat a **meal high in carbs and sugar (and fat), with low fiber and protein, we get an insulin spike and then a crash** (like Bitcoin in 2017). After the crash, we are hungry again.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Grains (pasta is from grains), dried fruits, sugar, and honey usually have 350kcal per 100g**. If you add the nuts and seeds, 100g granola (or muesli) can have 450 kcal per 100g, with minimal protein and fiber.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA better option is oatmeal with fruits and low fat cottage cheese or yogurt. Oatmeal, like bread, popcorn, or rice cakes, is expanded cereal, which adds more volume and fewer calories (~35% fewer calories.)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   choose low-fat foods if losing body fat is your goal;\r\n-   use oil and butter carefully, with a spray or teaspoon;\r\n-   avoid nuts and seeds;\r\n-   choose expanded grains (bread, popcorn, oatmeal, rice cakes) instead of ready to eat grains (granola, muesli, cornflakes, .etc.).\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[7]={id:"my-daily-routines",author:a,title:"My Daily Routines To Stay Fit And Healthy",createdOn:"Sep 16, 2020",categories:b,description:"I am a big believer in the power of example, and I am better off applying what a person does by watching her than taking advice from her.

Keeping this in mind, I decided to write some of the daily habits that help me stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\nI also put an almost naked picture with me to show you that I am not a fat guy, just writing articles out of my experience. Now, I am not a good photographer, and the picture is not that professional or artistic, but it does its job showing that I am pretty fit: I am 1.80m, weigh 79kg, and my body fat percentage is around 12%.\r\n\r\nIn this article, I will cover my **diet, exercise, and sleep habits.**\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\n\r\nI usually have **two meals and two snacks a day**, and my main food groups are **vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.** I also drink **at least three liters of water** per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI start the day by drinking 1 liter of water, a **protein shake with greens powder** and creatine (around 200kcal), and with some **coffee**. After I do some work, I prepare my first main meal, usually around 11:00 a.m. The **whey protein shake, creatine, greens powder, vitamin D3, medicinal mushrooms (for immunity) are the only supplements I take.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy first main meal is usually an **omelet** (five eggs and six egg whites), two cans of **grilled mackerel in water**, three slices of **toast bread**, some **tomatoes**, some **red peppers**, some **greek yogurt**, some **fruit**, and some **green tea**. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe second meal is usually around 5:00 p.m., and I will have **some lean meat with vegetables**. It can be grilled **chicken breast**, baked **sweet potatoes**, and some **salad** in some days. On other days, it can be some grilled **beef** with **potatoes** and salad. Sometimes I will make a **stew** with lots of vegetables and lean meat. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter this meal, I will eat some **fruit**, depending on the season. It can be watermelon, peaches, nectarines, blackberries, apples, cherries, clementines, etc. This snack is around 300kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like consistency. **I enjoy eating the same foods**, my favorite foods, over and over again. It requires less mental energy. I never have cheat meals because I don't need them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are days and periods I am away from home, or I hang out with my friends, girlfriend, or (and) family. When this happens, I focus on my favorite food groups: vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. If these are not present, I eat small portions of something similar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI drink alcohol on occasions, but only when I have a day off from everything the next day, usually on Saturday or Friday. When I drink, I choose low-calorie drinks, like wine, cognac, or \"rachiu\" (a beverage from Romania similar to tequila, but better).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI try to avoid, when not at home, fried foods, fatty foods, and deserts. These are high in calories, low in volume, and highly palatable. They make me eat them without stopping.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy strategy is to **eat foods high in volume, rich in water, fiber, and protein, and low in calories**. It is the reason why I eat vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. These foods fill me up with the least amount of calories. They also offer me all the essential nutrients I need: amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't keep in my house trigger foods, foods that I like so much that I cannot stop eating them after I begin. For me, these foods are peanut butter and coconut, or foods containing them. I like them so much that I cannot stop myself at a bite.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be as lean as possible. Of course, I want to increase my muscle mass as well, but I don't think I have the genetics to be a monster. To achieve my goal, I stay in a constant calorie deficit or maintenance at a maximum and eat sufficient protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My daily requirements are ~3000kcal, and I eat ~2500kcal.** Some days I burn less and eat less. It depends. I also aim to consume **200g protein per day,** to build and preserve my muscle mass, and 100g fats. I don't care how much carbs I consume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **eat only foods you enjoy and avoid trigger foods, but make sure they are high in volume and low in calories.**\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nI love walking. I **walk everyday 6-15km**. During these sessions, I burn 350-900kcal. It is an exercise I can do regardless of the weather, with any equipment, anywhere, any time. It also helps me relax, makes me feel better, and sleep better.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am also a fan of strength training. **I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and train all the muscle groups in one session**. For a while, I went to the gym six days per week, using the push-pull-legs split, but it was too exhausting, and I didn't have the Saturday off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe full-body training split ensures I equally train all the muscle groups, and I have a rest day between sessions for my muscles and nervous system to recover. I also have the weekends off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **do the exercises you enjoy and which you can stick to** regardless of external circumstances.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is so underrated these days. We cannot make wise decisions and function at our full potential without good quality sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sleep, it is not much to say. I **fall asleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 08:00 a.m.** every day. Sometimes, on weekends, I go to bed later and wake up later, but not every weekend. Whenever I can, I stick to my sleeping schedule, and I aim **towards 8-9 hours of sleep per night.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have some habits before bed, though. **After 10:30 p.m. (1 hour before sleep), all lights are turned off** and avoid them. Artificial lights make me alert and disrupt my melatonin (sleep hormone) levels. Maybe it happens to you too. I also **keep the room dark as a cave and not too warm.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn my phone and laptop, I use the Iris app to filter out blue light, which hurts my eyes and disrupts my sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed that chamomile tea before bed helps me sleep a lot better, so I drink 2-4 cups before bed. When I don't have tea, I take a sleep supplement with valerian root, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d3, and melatonin. I don't recommend any supplements to anyone; I am just informing what I do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours** so that the body sets its circadian rhythm. Also, avoid any form of artificial light 1 hour before bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat is all my friends. The big lesson you need to take from this article is to **create a routine for life that you enjoy.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I eat foods high in volume and low in calories (vegetables, fruit, and lean meats), that I enjoy, and avoid foods that I can't stop eating;\r\n-   I walk every day and train my entire body three times per week;\r\n-   I go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours, and avoid artificial light one hour before bed;\r\n-   one day per week, I don't stick to my routines and enjoy life with my loved ones.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[8]={id:"do-this-and-youll-lose-fat",author:a,title:"Do This And You'll Lose Fat",createdOn:"Sep 11, 2020",categories:b,description:"So much noise out there.

So many opinions and so much confusion. If you are reading this, I guess you are struggling with getting lean and staying lean.\r\n\r\nI've been fluctuating with my weight and body composition throughout my life in a visible manner. I've been experimenting with some diets and eating patterns, and I've found that only one trick worked. It's not just me, but the majority of people. It's the **law of physics** that will never be broken.\r\n\r\nDoes it require discipline? Yes! Is it simple? Yes! Is it easy? In the beginning, not at all. In the beginning, nothing is easy, but if you want to be lean, then you will do it.\r\n\r\n# Calorie deficit\r\n\r\nThe calorie deficit is the holy grail of body composition. Body fat, adipose tissue, is stored energy. Energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, just transformed.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with calories, **calories are a unit of measurement for energy**. Our bodies require energy to function every day. We use energy when we think, when we digest, when our heart pumps blood, when our organs do their jobs. Nothing can be achieved without energy.\r\n\r\nWe get the **energy from the food we consume**. Every food has some energy. If it's packaged, the food has a label and you can see some nutrition facts on the label. The first one, bolded is energy.\r\n\r\n**If we ingest more energy than we burn, that energy will be stored in our body somewhere, so we will gain weight**. If we burn more than we ingest, that energy will be released and used. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion.\r\n\r\n# How many calories do we need?\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's pretty hard, nearly **impossible to estimate 100% accurately how much we ingest and burn** throughout that day. This is why so many people say calorie counting is useless. It is not useless. Don't be discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily about tracking 100% accurate. It is more about **being mindful of everything you put in your mouth**. Trust me, you can lose fat without moving a finger if you're tracing your calories properly.\r\n\r\nYou just need to be approximately around your calorie goals. In the last 7 years, the only thing that worked for me to be lean and stay lean is calorie count and being in a calorie deficit. Ask any professional fitness coach or nutritionist and they will tell you the same.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have some metabolic or hormonal disorder. In these cases, your metabolism is in chaos, and may be hard to estimate your resting metabolic rate. If this is the case, you'll have to experiment with some daily calories on a weekly basis and see how your body changes and then adjust from there. The calorie equation still applies.\r\n\r\nI recommend you **use an app** to do this job, otherwise, it is overkill. You can use my app, [https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F](https:\u002F\u002Flifestyletrack.web.app\u002F). You can track your body composition, diet, and exercise habits. It will do all the calculations for you.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing you need is to **calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR)**. This is the energy your body consumes when your sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, it is around 2000 kcal per day. This is why the professionals set 2000kcal as the average daily caloric requirements. It is not correct though. We are not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to **track your eating habits**. Everything that you eat and has calories, track it.\r\n\r\nLastly, track your **physical activities**. From housework to intense workouts.\r\n\r\nThe energy balance equation is this: **food - resting metabolic rate - physical activities**. Again, my application will do this for you.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lose fat, the energy balance equation must be **slightly less than 0 (max -10% of required)**. If you want to gain some healthy weight, the energy balance equation must be **slightly more than 0 (max +10% of required)**. For maintenance, **around 0**  **(+\u002F-3% of required)**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   you need to track your calories if you want to change your body composition;\r\n-   if you want to lose fat, you need to be in a slight calorie deficit (10%);\r\n-   if you want to gain healthy weight, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus (10%);\r\n-   if you want to maintain, you need to be in calorie maintenance.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***\r\n"};f[9]={id:"read-this-before-going-vegan",author:a,title:"Read This Before Going Vegan",createdOn:"Dec 17, 2019",categories:b,description:"You saw the latest vegan documentary among the other bunch of documentaries and have decided to incorporate si diet into your lifestyle.

However, if your motivation is the latter, we have a problem.\r\n\r\nJust because something works for one or more individuals, doesn't mean it will work for you. We are unique to the biochemical and genetic level. We need to find out what is right for us through experimentation regardless of what others say and do.\r\n\r\nEven if your goal is longevity, vitality, or performance, veganism may not be optimal for you. Fat burning is all a matter of overall caloric and hormonal balance. Veganism may make you store more fat. The only valid goals for veganism are spiritual and environmental protection. Otherwise, try it temporarily and listen to your body.\r\n\r\n# Human Evolution\r\n\r\nMany vegans claim that humans are not meant to eat food from animal sources. We are plant consumers through nature. Are we now?\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at our predecessors, the primates. Are they vegan? Of course not. They indeed eat plants (fruits, leaves, roots) primarily, but also eat insects, birds, and eggs when plants are not available (off-season). Before agriculture, we have been hunter-gatherers for millions of years and fed from plants in season and animals off-season. We are omnivores.\r\n\r\n# Is it for you?\r\n\r\nIgnore when people say that we are meant to be vegans or veganism is better than other diets. You are not the same as other people and are not necessarily intended to be vegan.\r\n\r\nThe only way to know if it is right for you is to give it a shot for a few weeks and see how your body responds. If you feel better as the days go by, then kudos to you. Otherwise, don't force yourself dogmatically. Always listen to your body because it knows what is best for it.

The more nutrient-dense food is, the higher it's quality.\r\n\r\n## Macronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Carbohydrates;\r\n-   Proteins;\r\n-   Lipids;\r\n-   Water.\r\n\r\n## Micronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Vitamins;\r\n-   Minerals.\r\n\r\nWe should no longer see food as just belly-filling, hunger inhibiting substance. Food should be cellular nourishment.\r\n\r\n## Essential nutrients\r\n\r\nNow, upon these nutrients, not all of them are essential. Some of them can be produced internally by the body (non-essential). Our focus should be mostly on the essential nutrients.\r\n\r\n-   **Water**;\r\n-   **Major Minerals** (Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium);\r\n-   **Trace Minerals** (Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine);\r\n-   **Amino Acids** (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine);\r\n-   **Fatty Acids** (Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid);\r\n-   **Vitamins** (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic acid, Cobalamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Choline).\r\n\r\nIn the next articles, we'll focus on each nutrient group.

You have the money, the time, the motivation to get started. Still, I genuinely believe you need to have some essential points in mind coming from my personal experience of a consistent workout routine (13 years).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't go to the gym as I invested in equipment and work out at home 6 times per week.\r\n\r\nYou can read my article on \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle)\" for more detailed bodybuilding information. Also, \"[The Secrets Of Fat Loss](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-secrets-of-fat-loss)\" offers comprehensive information on how to lose fat, not just weight.\r\n\r\n# Consistency\r\n\r\nIt is not what you do once in a while that counts; it is what you do consistently. If you want to see results from your hard work, you need to be consistent.\r\n\r\n3 times per week is an ideal gym schedule for busy people. If you have more time and enjoy going to the gym, 6 times per week is perfect.\r\n\r\n# Form & Execution\r\n\r\nYou will see huge guys and maybe women lifting very heavy dumbbells and barbells. Don't be discouraged. Everybody started small.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to the gym just for aerobics, start with small intervals. It's ok if you cannot complete the entire workout in the beginning.\r\n\r\nRemember, focus on each repetition or interval and on your breath. Many professional bodybuilders sacrifice good form and cheat their reps just to lift heavy. That is wrong and leads to injury.\r\n\r\nStart small and continuously progress (increase the sets, reps, weights, distance, pace, etc.). to avoid a plateau. You can also switch the exercise routine to prevent acclimatization to the exercise. Check \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle).\"\r\n\r\n# Duration\r\n\r\nYou don't need to spend more than 1 hour in the gym. An intense and heavy workout can be completed in less than 1 hour if you are focused and don't waste time.\r\n\r\nIf you are doing aerobics\u002Fcardio and don't have your heart raised to 150 bpm and not sweating, you are not working intensely enough.\r\n\r\nIf you are lifting weights and don't feel the pump or burn, you are not lifting correctly or heavy enough.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\n\r\nExercise is just a tiny part of the equation. Regardless of your goals, you need to have a healthy, balanced diet.\r\n\r\nWant to build muscle? More calories (10%) and protein.\r\nWant to burn fat? Fewer calories (10%) and intermittent fasting.\r\nWant to be healthy? Eat natural, unprocessed food.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to restrict carbs or fat or anything. Just eat real food as natural and minimally processed as possible. This implies a lot of home preparation and cooking.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to drink lots of water. 3L per day is optimal. If you also live in a hot climate or it is summer, 5L is optimal.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nThe body needs to recover. The body is broken down and stressed out in the gym. It is during sleep when the muscle cells are rebuilt and when our healing hormones are secreted.\r\n\r\nA regular sleep schedule is the hardest thing to do in this century. Everybody hates going early to bed. How can we skip going out or watching the latest episode of Money Heist on Netflix?\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want results, you need to sleep from 10:00 pm to 4-5 am at least 5 days per week. Sleep quantity is not that important as sleep quality. 6-7 hours of good quality sleep is perfect. If you have time to sleep more, good for you.\r\n\r\n# Supplements\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, you don't need any supplements. What you need is correct exercise execution and constant progress, a nutritious and balanced diet, and good quality sleep. That's it!\r\n\r\nAfter you've maintained a routine for at least a year, then you can start investing in supplements.\r\n\r\nWhat most fitness addicts recommend is:\r\n\r\n-   whey isolate protein (or pea + hemp protein mix if you're a vegan);\r\n-   l-glutamine;\r\n-   creatine monohydrate;\r\n-   l-carnitine;\r\n-   organic vitamins and minerals complex;\r\n-   krill oil;\r\n-   for lazy days, a pre-workout (citrulline malate, beta-alanine, caffeine).\r\n\r\nAny other supplement is not worth the hype.\r\n\r\n# Patience\r\n\r\nLower your expectations. Don't expect to see significant results in just a month. If you would like to be like Dwayne Johnson, keep in mind that he has been having a healthy and disciplined lifestyle (exercise, diet, sleep) for 10+ years. He is also has a genetically large bone structure.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you would kile to be 6% body fat and have been fat in the past, you need to track your diet plan very strictly.\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***\r\n"};f[12]={author:a,title:"The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle",id:"the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle",createdOn:"Aug 28, 2019",categories:d,description:"It is time to eliminate the fitness industry bullshit and get old-school.

Muscle building is all about science.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Anatomy and Physiology\r\n**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.\r\nOnly one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**\r\n\r\nThere are three types of muscle fibers:\r\n- **Type I: slow-twitch\u002Foxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIA: fast-twitch\u002Foxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\r\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\r\n\r\nThe size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).\r\n\r\nThe primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.\r\n\r\nThe **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:\r\n- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);\r\n- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);\r\n- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\nATP replenishment times:\r\n- 20 sec - 50.00 %;\r\n- 40 sec - 75.00 %;\r\n- 1 min - 87.50 %;\r\n- 80 sec - 93.75 %;\r\n- 100 sec - 96.88 %;\r\n- 2 mins - 98.44 %;\r\n- 140 sec - 99.22 %;\r\n- 160 sec - 99.61 %;\r\n- 3 min - 99.81 %.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)\r\nThere are two types of hypertrophy:\r\n- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;\r\n- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\r\n\r\nSarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).\r\n\r\n**_Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time._**\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called **satellite cells** become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\nHormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:\r\n- **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);**\r\n- **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);**\r\n- **Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);**\r\n- **Growth hormone (GH);**\r\n- **Testosterone.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\r\n\r\n# Efficient, targeted strength training\r\nIf our goals are to build muscle or\u002Fand strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let's see:\r\n\r\n|Fiber type|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I|+15|70%|2 - 0 - 1|\r\n|Type IIA|6-12|75-85%|4 - 0 - 3|\r\n|Type IIB|1-3|+90%|3 - 1 - 1|\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nGeekier:\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I sarcomere hypertrophy|15-50|\u003C70%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|\u003E50|\u003C50%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy|6-15|70-85%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|12-25|50-70%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy|3-5|85-95%|3-1-1|\r\n|Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|6-12|70-85%|3-1-1|\r\n|Absolute strength|1-2|\u003E90%|3-1-1|\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nBriefly:\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Sets|Reps per set|%1rep-max(1RM)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Maximum muscle size|3|6-12|75-85%|\r\n|Maximum strength|3-7|1-5|\u003E85%|\r\n|Combined muscle and strength|3|3-12|75-90%|\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\nBe careful to **perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.** Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.\r\n\r\n# Best strength training exercises\r\nThe best strength training exercises are unquestionably the **free weight compound movements:**\r\n- **Squats;**\r\n- **Deadlifts;**\r\n- **Bench Presses \u002F Weighted Push-ups;**\r\n- **Parallel Dips;**\r\n- **Bent Over Rows**\r\n- **Pull-ups \u002F Chin-Ups**\r\n- **Military Presses**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.\r\n\r\nConstantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity\u002Fweights when you feel you reached a plateau.\r\n  \r\n# Training frequency\r\nThe muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must **train each muscle group 2-3 times per week**. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.\r\n\r\nFor busy people who don't have much time to spend in the gym, **three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough**. This program also applies to small-boned\u002Fsmall-jointed people.\r\n\r\nSmall-boned characteristics:\r\n- Wrist circumferences \u003C10.5% of the height;\r\n- Ankle circumferences \u003C13.0% of the height.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body's systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.\r\n\r\nIdeally, **a rest day should follow each training day.**\r\n\r\nMuscle fatigue is caused by:\r\n- Lactic acid accumulation;\r\n- ATP shortage;\r\n- PC shortage;\r\n- Inorganic phosphate accumulation;\r\n- Peripheral nervous system fatigue;\r\n- Central nervous system fatigue.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\nThe **training session should be for 45-75 minutes**.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\nFor building muscle, we need **minimum 2g\u002Fkg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g\u002Fkg of body weight of dietary fat per day,** and **10% caloric surplus**. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.\r\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:\r\n- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);\r\n- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;\r\n- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);\r\n- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\r\n\r\n# Other lifestyle factors\r\nOf course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.\r\n\r\nSleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nMake sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.\r\n\r\n**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n- train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;\r\n- focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;\r\n- execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;\r\n- for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;\r\n- for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in \u003E85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;\r\n- for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;\r\n- constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;\r\n- rest ~2 minutes between sets;\r\n- train for 45-75 minutes;\r\n- ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;\r\n- whole good quality food;\r\n- min 1g\u002Fkg\u002Fday of complete protein;\r\n- min 1g\u002Fkg\u002Fday of dietary fat;\r\n- scheduled good quality sleep;\r\n- 2-6L water per day;\r\n- relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Fphysiology\u002Fmuscle1.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Fphysiology\u002Fmuscle2.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Fphysiology\u002Fmuscle3.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Fphysiology\u002Fgrowth1.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Fphysiology\u002Fgrowth2.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength\u002FSize Routine Part I: Exercise Selection](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Fselection.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength\u002FSize Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Fsequence.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength\u002FSize Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Freps.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength\u002FSize Routine Part IV: Training Frequency](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Ffrequency.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength\u002FSize Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Fsplit.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.weightrainer.net\u002Ftraining\u002Frules.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FagUmfvM4rjw);\r\n - [The Truth About Rep Ranges & Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FyLR9rfuE6Sg).\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***\r\n"};f[13]={author:a,title:"The Secrets Of Fat Loss",id:"the-secrets-of-fat-loss",createdOn:"Aug 12, 2019",categories:d,description:"The fat loss formula: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.",image:"https:\u002F\u002Ffirebasestorage.googleapis.com\u002Fv0\u002Fb\u002Flifestyle-maniacs.appspot.com\u002Fo\u002Fimages%2Fthe-secrets-of-fat-loss%2F_main.jpg?alt=media&token=19b212f7-66eb-475a-acf3-31b934af4654",imageCredit:"Photo by Gesina Kunkel on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FIP0Y3axkpJE",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\the-secrets-of-fat-loss.md"},markdown:"Oh, I know what you're thinking right now: \"Not another fat loss post to confuse me even further...\".

They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.\r\n\r\nThe secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.\r\n\r\nThese foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.\r\n\r\nI will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.\r\n\r\nFor fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.\r\n\r\nMovement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.\r\n\r\n**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**\r\n\r\nSleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep, our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.\r\n\r\nAlso, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or\u002Fand fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe ideal sleeping time is from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m., but we cannot all follow that schedule. Thus, I suggest going to bed and waking up every day at the same time and make sure you sleep 7-9 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can also try some of these [sleeping hacks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fsleeping-hacks).\r\n\r\nNow we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?\r\n\r\nTo tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.\r\n\r\nInsulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.\r\n\r\nRemember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**\r\n\r\nThe question is now: when is insulin in the blood?\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.\r\n\r\nThere has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**\r\n\r\nThis is why diets low in carbohydrates (e.g. Keto) and intermittent fasting are so effective for fat loss. I prefer intermittent fasting as it is easier to maintain and it also offers many health benefits.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water. This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy.\r\n\r\nYou can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;\r\n - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;\r\n - **Stay active** throughout the day;\r\n - Have a **regular sleep schedule**, ideally from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m.;\r\n - Go **low carb** or try **intermittent fasting**.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [Do Calories Matter?
