In other words, **eat every three hours**.\n\nWhat if I told you this is **the biggest bull-shit and stupidity we have ever heard and made** since our human evolution?\n\nThink about it; we are the only species on the planet that eat every two or three hours per day. Every **other species eats and stops for hours or days**.\n\nOk, maybe herbivores eat all day, but we are not herbivores. Even they fast during the winter when there are no more leaves or grasses.\n\n**Fasting is a natural process** with many benefits, and we are preventing stealing these benefits from our bodies.\n\n### Storytime\n\nI started to learn how to eat correctly in 2005 when I went to the doctor because **I was too fat**. He told me that a balanced diet should include three meals a day and two snacks.\n\nWell, I lost weight, but not with advice. I started doing **intermittent fasting without even knowing** about it. Of course, I also changed what I ate, not only how I ate.\n\nI also started playing sports — handball. I had training at 8:00 a.m., and I couldn’t eat in the morning because I would throw up during the practice because of the intensity. So, I skipped breakfast and ate when I got back home.\n\nMy first meal was at 10:30–11:00 a.m.. I also ate at school and 7:00–8:00 p.m. So, **I was fasting for 14–16 hours** without even knowing it at 11 years old. Of course, I was **also in a caloric deficit**.\n\nAs a result, I lost 20kg in 2 years. I also had a 6-pack without doing crunches.\n\n### The Fitness Industry Corrupted Me\n\nAfter years, I started going to the gym and reading fitness blogs. I read that to build muscle and boost metabolism, you need to **eat every 2–3 hours. Otherwise, muscles won’t grow but shrink.**\n\nI followed this advice for years, and I **did not have a life**. Everywhere I want I had to plan to be exactly after my last meal. In other cases, I needed to have a meal packed with me all the time. It was a pain in the ass.\n\n**I was living to eat, not eating to live.** Fitness and food controlled my life.\n\nAfter a while, I started to learn about human physiology and hormones. I came across a doctor who said we were skipping breakfast and fasting and explained why. I was interested, so I started to learn more.\n\nI learned about fasting and its benefits to health and fitness, so I applied it to my lifestyle. It was a total failure. Why? Because I didn’t track my calories. I learned that **fasting without being in a caloric deficit does not affect fat loss**.\n\nIn the end, the best approach to fat loss for me was intermittent fasting combine with caloric deficit or maintenance.\n\n### Why intermittent fasting?\n\nFasting for at least sixteen hours puts the body into a state of lipolysis, ketosis, and cellular autophagy. In other words, you enter **fat-burning and healing mode**.\n\nIn more detail, fasting can improve biomarkers, have anti-aging benefits, have metabolic benefits[[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fintermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156)[[2]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC5783752\u002F), and prevent cancer[[3]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC6938162\u002F). The last one is obvious because of cellular autophagy.\n\nThere are many other benefits if you begin to search for research studies on this topic. In Layman’s terms, **fasting heals the body and triggers fat-burning mode.**\n\n### Fasting is not for every one\n\nOf course, fasting is not for everyone. If you are pregnant, a child below ten years old, or have medical issues, then fasting may not be for you.\n\nYou should consult your doctor before starting any routine.\n\n### How I fast\n\nI fast between 8:00–9:00 p.m. until 12:00–1:00 p.m. I also exercise on an empty stomach (cardio o strength training) because **fasting does not burn muscle**[[5]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=teQIaU6wp2o&t=7s).\n\nDuring my fast, I drink only water, herbal tea, and black coffee, without milk or sweeteners.\n\nSometimes, I fast for 24 hours, sometimes for 14. Sometimes I skip fasting because of some events. However, I fast 16 hours 6 times per week.\n\nEver since I started to fast, I feel free, and I control my weight and lifestyle, not the other way around.\n\n### References\n\n1.

However, they are wrong when they say gold, stocks, or cash have intrinsic value.\n\n# History of money\n\nIn the beginning, we used  **bartering**  as a form of transacting value —  **a medium of exchange**. People traded  **a cow for two sheep,**  for example. The person who sold a specific service or good gave the value.\n\nThe cow produces  milk and meat, whereas the sheep provides both, but in smaller quantities. Thus, the buyer and seller may negotiate and agree that a cow is worth two or three sheep. Makes sense?\n\nOver time, people evolved and started using some  **common currency**  to have a more stable and standard valuation of goods and services.\n\nIt makes sense because a person may say that a cow is more valuable than a horse, while another person may say the exact contrary. People needed a  **standard value estimation — store of value**. Hence, people started minting gold coins.\n\n**People chose gold**  as a store of value because of its nature: it  **doesn’t oxidate,** it can be **modeled into weighed coins,** and  it is **scarce**. Gold has stood the test of time as the standard value — the gold standard — mostly because people agreed upon it.\n\nFor sure, there are other earthly elements with similar anti-oxidative properties and scarcity, but people agreed to gold. It is a  **convention given by people**, not by universal laws. I hope it makes sense.\n\nOver time people started putting their gold into safe deposits and received a  **paper that proved their deposited wealth**. People used those papers for transactions instead of physical gold, which was also harder to transport.\n\nThe gold deposits were the first banks. Over time, banks started giving  **papers for the same gold deposit**  when people wanted to borrow gold because people never withdrew their gold. They  **relied on the paper proof**  of gold and not the gold itself.\n\nIt is how the case monetary system came into existence. People came into agreement that the number printed on the paper is the actual value.\n\nFor decades, the paper money of a country was the equivalent of gold it possessed. All until president Richard Nixon exited from his gold standard in 1978. Since then,  **governments could print money as much as they wanted**.\n\nNote: I tried to describe the history of money as briefly as possible and may have skipped some details. If you want to learn more about the history of money, how banks work, and why our monetary system is broken, please check:\n\n-   [The History of Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002F07\u002Froots_of_money.asp)\n-   [Why Has Gold Always Been Valuable?](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002Finvesting\u002F071114\u002Fwhy-gold-has-always-had-value.asp#gold-psychology-and-society)\n-   [How Banks Create Money](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=O5DaC1Ujrrg)\n-   [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s)\n\n# Why Stocks Are Speculative\n\nAs we saw, commodities and cash have no value if people agree they do not. The story with stocks is a bit different. Stocks represent fractional ownership of a public company, according to  [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fs\u002Fstock.asp).\n\nYou may think a stock price goes up because the company’s profit goes up. We saw during the pandemic that  **although companies’ profits went down, stocks went up**.\n\nThe Buffet Indicator confirms that the stock market prices have detached from the current state of the economy.\n\nThe stock market — and other markets — went up because people started gambling on RobinHood, eToro, and other online brokerages during the pandemic.\n\nHow come people had money to invest during the pandemic? Because they could not travel, could not hang out, and stayed at home. The pandemic prevented people from spending, thus, reorienting them to online investing.\n\nSo, why does do markets go up on exchanges? Because people buy. It is the hard truth. When a  **lot of money goes into a stock, the stock goes up and vice versa.**  It is what happened with AMC and GameStop as well.\n\nAll of this means  **hype can create the illusion of value**. If most people agree Tesla has value and buy its stock, the stock will go up, and it did. It had a P\u002FE ratio (Price relative to Earnings) of almost 1000. Extremely overpriced.\n\n# Crypto hype is history repeating\n\nThe crypto hype is the new hype of the online and informational revolution. At the beginning of the century — and millennium — we had the internet hype — Dotcom bubble. In 1720, we had the South Sea bubble. Now, we have the Crypto bubble.\n\nYes, it is a bubbl**e because the market is new, prices spike quickly, and people become very greedy**. A new market is easy to manipulate through social media and online news (e.g., pump and dump or fud).\n\nAs we saw,  **Elon Musk tweets Doge and the price goes up 1000 times**. Dogecoin — and other meme coins — are a joke (literally). However, if people believe they have value, they will have value.\n\nNow, there are companies and projects with some fundamentals behind the chart.\n\nFor instance, if GOOGL’s price goes down, by just knowing and understanding the company’s fundamentals, you can predict the price will come back in the future. Why? Because the  **company itself has value, not the stock.**\n\nHowever, if everybody decided Google has no value for some reason (e.g., it steals personal information, another company is better), the company will go to hell.\n\nThe same logic applies to all markets, including crypto. I choose to invest in  **Ethereum**  because of its potential to become (decentralized) Web 3.0. I also choose to invest in  **Bitcoin**  because I believe it is a better alternative to gold.\n\n# Blockchain technology is the future\n\nThere is a book called  **“The Bitcoin Standard”**  which describes the current flaws of our monetary system and why  **Bitcoin, among other things, is a good store of value**.\n\nBitcoin is not and will not be the only crypto out there. Many crypto projects, like Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana, have huge potential.\n\nThe name  **cryptocurrency is not intuitive**, in my opinion. Crypto assets or blockchain projects are a better naming because crypto is not just for finance but for other applications in our world.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nIn whatever asset, be it stock, commodity, or crypto, money goes, the price will follow, as well as money outside the asset. This process makes any publicly traded asset prone to manipulation.\n\nThis makes you understand the everything has no value until people believe in it and give it value.\n\nIf I ask for my house $100.000, but no one will offer me that price, my price is not worth $100.000. As long as there is a person willing to pay the price, the good or service has that asked price (value), otherwise, it doesn’t.\n\nDespite the fud and misconceptions about crypto, it is here to stay. People will slowly believe crypto has value and will incorporate it into their lives. They first need to understand the potential crypto has and the problems it solves.\n\n----------\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

How do I know this? By looking at some fundamental market indicators and at the overall economy. We are at the **end of a big cycle like in 1929** before the Great Depression.\n\n### Pandemic\n\nThe thing is, our economy went to hell because of the pandemic, and we have not recovered. Even though now we have begun to travel again, people are **not spending like they used to**. This rhymes with what happened after World War I.\n\nIf you think the pandemic is over, think again. We will probably see **another lockdown during cold periods**. We have relaxed this summer because of vaccinations, but the percentage is still low. **In Romania, less than 30% are vaccinated**.\n\n### Hyperinflation\n\nStimulus after stimulus. The US and EU have been **printing money like never before**. Trillions of dollars and euros were printed this year and last year. This **caused all prices to go up.**\n\nWe see the effect of hyperinflation and **high prices in commodities**: gold, silver, copper, oil, food products, etc.\n\n### The Buffet Indicator\n\n[The Buffet Indicator](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.currentmarketvaluation.com\u002Fmodels\u002Fbuffett-indicator.php) evaluates the US stock market. Currently, it is **strongly overvalued**. The rationale is simple, **people without jobs switched to online gambling**, which is what investment has become this year and last year.\n\nThe stock prices have been going up, while the GDP has been going down. We have never seen such disconnection in the stock market. If you look at the P\u002FE ratio of most stocks, even at the S&P 500, it is high and indicates overvaluation.\n\n### Overpriced real-estate\n\nHave you seen the prices of real estate in the past two years? The reason for this is that [**people have stopped selling their houses**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.realtor.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fdecember-2020-data\u002F) since the pandemic. By the law of supply and demand, **low supply and high demand** increase the price.\n\nBut why would people want to buy a house during the pandemic? Because of all-time  [**low mortgage rates**](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.freddiemac.com\u002Fpmms\u002F)**.**\n\nNot only this, but the **prices of the building materials have also increased** a lot, besides inflation.\n\n### Crypto cycles\n\nThe crypto market flows according to the supply and demand of Bitcoin. **Every four years, the bitcoin reward for mining is cut in half (halving)**. The Bitcoin halving decreases the production of Bitcoin, hence, lower supply.\n\nAfter every Bitcoin halving, the crypto market starts the bull run, and everything goes up. Until Bitcoin is dethroned by Ethereum, we will still see these 4-year cycles.\n\nBecause of its scarcity, it [**follows the stock-to-flow model**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F). Currently, Bitcoin is undervalued, but it will most probably hit 100K at the beginning of 2022. Afterward, it will crash along with the entire crypto market.\n\nYou can find more Bitcoin evaluation tools [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002F).\n\n### Takeaways\n\n**I am not a financial adviser,** so I cannot recommend doing something with your money, but I will tell you my strategy.\n\n**I am not an investor, but a long-term trader**. I enter a long or short position which may last for months if the trend is strong. I am bullish on most markets, but for the short term. I am always **prepared to exit when the trend reverses, even on a small loss.**\n\nIf I were to be an investor, I would invest only the money I don’t need for the next 5 years. Also, I would **dollar cost average every month**.\n\nI would buy more during crashes and **never invest when an asset is overpriced**. Buy low, sell high.\n\n----------\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n### Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n### Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fyou-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n### Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n### A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n### Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n### Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fmy-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n### A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n### Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n### Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n### Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It seems I was right. Bitcoin went down to 29K, and the crypto market followed.\n\nOf course, I bought Bitcoin at 29K and afterward at 34K, as you see in the chart. I also bought ETH at 1.9K.\n\n### The Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nBuying Bitcoin at 34K was a mistake because I thought, at first, that we are in **Phase C of the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic**. However, a more careful chart analysis revealed that we are most probably — not for sure — in **Phase B**.\n\nIn my previous article, I said that we are about to end the **Wyckoff Distribution Schematic,** and it seems we did, probably sooner than I saw. We can easily see that the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic has begun, and we are in the middle of it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the **Wyckoff Method,** read my [previous article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fhow-to-prepare-for-the-next-bitcoin-correction-with-the-wyckoff-method) or go directly to the [source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*C4HuCEj_xSB-bpas8-ytjw.png)\n\n[Source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\nThe image above presents the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic with its phases. I applied this schematic to the Bitcoin daily chart, as you saw at the beginning of the article, and it seems we are in Phase B at ST.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong, and we may be in Phase C, but it is better to prepare for another bull trap at 40K and then a drop — bear trap — at 27k.\n\nI think Bitcoin will follow the arrows drawn in the chart. I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**. Thus, the bear market won’t come until 2022.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nNow, I cannot recommend and advise you into doing anything with your money because **I am not a financial advisor.** I can recommend **preparing for any scenario**. Nothing is certain, just probable.\n\nIf you want to educate yourself in the crypto market, I recommend reading [my article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fcrypto-research-tools-that-supercharged-my-investing-strategy) on this topic.

Not to mention the suicide rates.\n\nAlso, did you know that most **lottery winners end up broke**? That is the root cause of their misery.\n\nThe focus of this article is to make you change your perception of wealth. It is somehow counterintuitive to believe that making more money will make you wealthier.\n\n### Easy come, easy go\n\nIn S01:E14 of Two And A Half Men, Charlie goes broke. His accountant is trying to explain to him how this happened because Charlie was shocked. He gave a very intuitive explanation.\n\nHe made the analogy for cash flow by comparing it with water pouring inside a plastic cup with a hole at the bottom.\n\nWhen water comes inside the cup faster than it drains, the cup remains full for a while, even after the water stops flowing. Of course, this happens if the hole is only one and not too large.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, he had ten holes at the bottom of the cup, and as soon as water stopped coming, the cup stopped having water.\n\nThe analogy is simple: **if you spend more than you earn, you will always be poor.**\n\nIf you have zero or a negative balance in your wallet or bank account at the end of each month, then you are spending too much. You will not even realize this but will think you are not earning enough.\n\nSay you do find a solution to earn more money, and you succeed. Do you think it will fix the root cause of your case? In most cases, it will not because your mindset is the same.\n\n**The real issue you have a consumer mindset. When you have more, you think you afford more. As a result, you spend more.**\n\nIf you were to change your mindset from a consumer to an investor, you would realize you spend too much on liabilities and not on assets.\n\nAlso, you would see that more money equals more savings for possible investments and not more spending on things you do not need.\n\n### Exceptions to the rule\n\nI get it. You are already cutting your expenses at a minimum because you were not so fortunate. In your case, the solution is only to increase your income.\n\nThere is a catch to this exception, though. If you were to make more money, you would probably have the urge to compensate for all those years of lack of wealth.\n\nThe example above is what happened to me. I made more money than I ever needed, and still, I ended up borrowing money from others from time to time. Fortunately, I realized my issues and fixed them at the right moment.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nIf you are struggling with your money, look first at your expenses before trying to earn more.\n\n-   check your bills: are you wasting electricity, water, gas, etc.?\n-   check your transportation: can you walk or take the bus instead of the car?\n-   check your subscriptions: do you need Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Amazon Prime, etc.?\n-   check your shopping: do you need new clothes, new accessories, new devices, etc.?\n\nThe list continues but, in summary, adopt a minimalistic lifestyle. Think twice before clicking the buy button.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
