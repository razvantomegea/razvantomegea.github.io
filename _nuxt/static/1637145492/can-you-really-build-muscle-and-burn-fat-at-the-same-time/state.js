However, we are in a paradox because the two objectives require opposite approaches. At least, that is what the fitness industry says.\n\nYou know the bodybuilder cycle: bulking up during cold periods (off-season), then cutting during hot periods.\n\nIsn’t there another way to build muscle and stay lean at the same time? In other words, lean gains, body recomposition, and maingain? Of course, it is possible. We need to understand the physiology of fat loss and muscle growth.\n\n# How do muscles grow?\n\nMuscle growth is an adaptation to regular acute stress. When resistance is applied to the muscle, it will adapt to manage that resistance in the future in a more efficient manner.\n\nIt does this by strengthing the neuromuscular connections and by increasing the size or number of the muscle fibers.\n\nHowever, the adaptation requires some resources. These are protein, water, energy, and some other micronutrients that sustain the process. The neuromuscular adaptation happens during rest.\n\n# How do we burn body fat?\n\nBody fat is stored (excess) energy. When we consume more energy than we need, that energy is not wasted but stored for later when we’ll possibly need it.\n\nThus, to burn body fat, we need to be in a state of energy deficiency, so that the body can use the stored energy — caloric deficit.\n\nNow, let’s think about it. To build muscle, we need to apply resistance to the muscles by going to the gym, provide energy, protein, water, and micronutrients, and recover (sleep).\n\nTo burn body fat, we need to be in a caloric deficit.\n\nWhy can’t these two happen at the same time? Muscle growth requires energy which can come from the body fat. Thus, we can build muscle and burn fat at the same time.\n\nAn important note here. If you are already under 10% body fat, then a slight caloric surplus is in order. By slight, I don’t mean 500kcal\u002Fday, but 5–10% of your daily needs. If you need 3000kcal\u002Fday, then a 150–300kcal surplus per day is enough.\n\nHowever, most people are not under 10% body fat, so you can be in a slight caloric deficit, lift weights, and still see body recomposition happening.\n\nYou can also be at energy maintenance; your body fat will support the energy required by muscle growth.\n\nSo you see, by applying basic physiology, we can debunk the myths surrounding us in the fitness industry.\n\nAlso, body recomposition is the best goal for everyone because it implies making fitness a lifestyle and not a short-term thing like bulking and cutting do. You are fit year-round for life.\n\nOf course, bulking and cutting are part of a lifestyle, but why put your body through that much weight change when you can go steady in the long term?";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1637145492",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fcan-you-really-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-at-the-same-time",config:{}}}(false,"Fitness","Can You Really Build Muscle And Burn Fat At The Same Time?",{},Array(1)));
