These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment. I am curious.\n\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
