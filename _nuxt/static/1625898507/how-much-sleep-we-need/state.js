It is false for many reasons, one of which is that we are different.\r\n\r\nBut why do we need to sleep in the first place?\r\n\r\nLet us skip the science for a second and put common sense on the table. Are you feeling better and more productive after a good night’s sleep? Are you feeling like a mess after a poor sleep or when you are sleep-deprived?\r\n\r\nWhen I have a good sleep, I feel I can conquer the world. On the contrary, I feel like a teenage girl during her period after a poor sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite feeling good, sleep helps us:\r\n\r\n-   lower our general body inflammation;\r\n-   making better decisions during the day, including to eat the right food and exercise;\r\n-   increase our libido;\r\n-   boost our immunity;\r\n-   boost general performance;\r\n-   manage stress.\r\n\r\nMore information about sleep benefits [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sleep.org\u002Fsleep-science\u002F), and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F).\r\n\r\n## 1. Quality over quantity\r\n\r\nIt is more important to get good quality sleep than a good quantity of sleep. There were times in my life in which I slept seven hours and a half per night and was full of energy and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nFrankly, there were other periods when I slept for twelve hours and was still tired. The reason for this is I changed my diet and started eating fatty foods and too many calories.\r\n\r\nFocusing on sleep duration changes our focus from what matters: deep sleep. Sleep was four stages: awake, light, non-REM (deep), and REM. The deep sleep phase is most important because our body heals in that period.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get the deep sleep we need is by helping our body know when to produce melatonin, the sleep-cycle hormone, before bed.\r\n\r\n-   go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time most of the days;\r\n-   avoid blue and cold light one hour before bed. Use f.lux or iris apps on your laptop and phones;\r\n-   avoid caffeine after lunch;\r\n-   keep the bedroom dark and cool (\u003C 20 degrees Celsius);\r\n-   have a sleep supplement or drink some tea with relaxing herbs.\r\n\r\nSleep is also cumulative. For instance, if you need six hours of sleep, you can get them by taking four naps of one hour and a half. There is also a sleep method called Uberman Sleep Cycle that advocates 6–8 equidistant 20-minute naps.\r\n\r\n## 2. Age\r\n\r\nAge influences how much sleep we need. The younger we are, the more (deep) sleep we need.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F0*5U3eXUOgTmus-zZg)\r\n\r\n[Credit](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F)\r\n\r\n## 3. Physical and intellectual activities\r\n\r\nA sedentary person or a person who does not do something during the day cannot have the same sleep needs as an athlete or a student who studies hard.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense that the more activities we do, both physical or intellectual, the more deep sleep we need.\r\n\r\n## 4. Genetics\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is a light sleeper. Any small noise or movement wakes her up, and she hardly falls asleep. Her father, on the contrary, sleeps like a bear in any place and at any time. I am in the middle.\r\n\r\nGenetics influences sleep, regardless of the lifestyle. Of course, lifestyle can help a lot, and we are not doomed to our genetic predispositions.\r\n\r\nSome persons sleep six hours and are fully charged, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, maybe because they have more deep sleep than others.\r\n\r\nI need 9 hours of sleep to be 100% charged. Of course, I have a regular sleep schedule and respect some of the points mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
