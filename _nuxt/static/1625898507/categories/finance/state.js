Also, if you have not seen [**“How The Economic Machine Works” by Ray Dalio**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0), I strongly recommend you watch it.\n\nWe are in an **everything bubble,** that is for sure. How do I know this? By looking at some fundamental market indicators and at the overall economy. We are at the **end of a big cycle like in 1929** before the Great Depression.\n\n### Pandemic\n\nThe thing is, our economy went to hell because of the pandemic, and we have not recovered. Even though now we have begun to travel again, people are **not spending like they used to**. This rhymes with what happened after World War I.\n\nIf you think the pandemic is over, think again. We will probably see **another lockdown during cold periods**. We have relaxed this summer because of vaccinations, but the percentage is still low. **In Romania, less than 30% are vaccinated**.\n\n### Hyperinflation\n\nStimulus after stimulus. The US and EU have been **printing money like never before**. Trillions of dollars and euros were printed this year and last year. This **caused all prices to go up.**\n\nWe see the effect of hyperinflation and **high prices in commodities**: gold, silver, copper, oil, food products, etc.\n\n### The Buffet Indicator\n\n[The Buffet Indicator](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.currentmarketvaluation.com\u002Fmodels\u002Fbuffett-indicator.php) evaluates the US stock market. Currently, it is **strongly overvalued**. The rationale is simple, **people without jobs switched to online gambling**, which is what investment has become this year and last year.\n\nThe stock prices have been going up, while the GDP has been going down. We have never seen such disconnection in the stock market. If you look at the P\u002FE ratio of most stocks, even at the S&P 500, it is high and indicates overvaluation.\n\n### Overpriced real-estate\n\nHave you seen the prices of real estate in the past two years? The reason for this is that [**people have stopped selling their houses**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.realtor.com\u002Fresearch\u002Fdecember-2020-data\u002F) since the pandemic. By the law of supply and demand, **low supply and high demand** increase the price.\n\nBut why would people want to buy a house during the pandemic? Because of all-time  [**low mortgage rates**](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.freddiemac.com\u002Fpmms\u002F)**.**\n\nNot only this, but the **prices of the building materials have also increased** a lot, besides inflation.\n\n### Crypto cycles\n\nThe crypto market flows according to the supply and demand of Bitcoin. **Every four years, the bitcoin reward for mining is cut in half (halving)**. The Bitcoin halving decreases the production of Bitcoin, hence, lower supply.\n\nAfter every Bitcoin halving, the crypto market starts the bull run, and everything goes up. Until Bitcoin is dethroned by Ethereum, we will still see these 4-year cycles.\n\nBecause of its scarcity, it [**follows the stock-to-flow model**](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fstock-to-flow-model\u002F). Currently, Bitcoin is undervalued, but it will most probably hit 100K at the beginning of 2022. Afterward, it will crash along with the entire crypto market.\n\nYou can find more Bitcoin evaluation tools [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002F).\n\n### Takeaways\n\n**I am not a financial adviser,** so I cannot recommend doing something with your money, but I will tell you what is my strategy.\n\n**I am not an investor, but a long-term trader**. I enter a long or short position which may last for months if the trend is strong. I am bullish on most markets, but for short-term. I am always **prepared to exit when the trend reverses, even on a small loss.**\n\nIf I were to be an investor, I would invest only the money I don’t need for the next 5 years. Also, I would **dollar cost average every month**.\n\nI would buy more during crashes and **never invest when an asset is overpriced**. Buy low, sell high.\n\n----------\n\n_Earn crypto writing articles on_ [_Publish0x_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.publish0x.com\u002F?a=MvbmQxPrbY)\n\n_Earn passive income from your crypto on_ [_Nexo.io_](https:\u002F\u002Fnexo.io\u002F?u=601537e84f1646693701d869) _and from P2P lending on_ [_Mintos_](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mintos.com\u002Fen\u002Fl\u002Fref\u002FWO9U2N)_._  \n  \n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It seems I was right. Bitcoin went down to 29K, and the crypto market followed.\n\nOf course, I bought Bitcoin at 29K and afterward at 34K, as you see in the chart. I also bought ETH at 1.9K.\n\n### The Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nBuying Bitcoin at 34K was a mistake because I thought, at first, that we are in **Phase C of the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic**. However, a more careful chart analysis revealed that we are most probably — not for sure — in **Phase B**.\n\nIn my previous article, I said that we are about to end the **Wyckoff Distribution Schematic,** and it seems we did, probably sooner than I saw. We can easily see that the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic has begun, and we are in the middle of it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the **Wyckoff Method,** read my [previous article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fhow-to-prepare-for-the-next-bitcoin-correction-with-the-wyckoff-method) or go directly to the [source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*C4HuCEj_xSB-bpas8-ytjw.png)\n\n[Source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\nThe image above presents the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic with its phases. I applied this schematic to the Bitcoin daily chart, as you saw at the beginning of the article, and it seems we are in Phase B at ST.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong, and we may be in Phase C, but it is better to prepare for another bull trap at 40K and then a drop — bear trap — at 27k.\n\nI think Bitcoin will follow the arrows drawn in the chart. I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**. Thus, the bear market won’t come until 2022.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nNow, I cannot recommend and advise you into doing anything with your money because **I am not a financial advisor.** I can recommend **preparing for any scenario**.

Not to mention the suicide rates.\n\nAlso, did you know that most **lottery winners end up broke**? That is the root cause of their misery.\n\nThe focus of this article is to make you change your perception of wealth. It is somehow counterintuitive to believe that making more money will make you wealthier.\n\n### Easy come, easy go\n\nIn S01:E14 of Two And A Half Men, Charlie goes broke. His accountant is trying to explain to him how this happened because Charlie was shocked. He gave a very intuitive explanation.\n\nHe made the analogy for cash flow by comparing it with water pouring inside a plastic cup with a hole at the bottom.\n\nWhen water comes inside the cup faster than it drains, the cup remains full for a while, even after the water stops flowing. Of course, this happens if the hole is only one and not too large.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, he had ten holes at the bottom of the cup, and as soon as water stopped coming, the cup stopped having water.\n\nThe analogy is simple: **if you spend more than you earn, you will always be poor.**\n\nIf you have zero or a negative balance in your wallet or bank account at the end of each month, then you are spending too much. You will not even realize this but will think you are not earning enough.\n\nSay you do find a solution to earn more money, and you succeed. Do you think it will fix the root cause of your case? In most cases, it will not because your mindset is the same.\n\n**The real issue you have a consumer mindset. When you have more, you think you afford more. As a result, you spend more.**\n\nIf you were to change your mindset from a consumer to an investor, you would realize you spend too much on liabilities and not on assets.\n\nAlso, you would see that more money equals more savings for possible investments and not more spending on things you do not need.\n\n### Exceptions to the rule\n\nI get it. You are already cutting your expenses at a minimum because you were not so fortunate. In your case, the solution is only to increase your income.\n\nThere is a catch to this exception, though. If you were to make more money, you would probably have the urge to compensate for all those years of lack of wealth.\n\nThe example above is what happened to me. I made more money than I ever needed, and still, I ended up borrowing money from others from time to time. Fortunately, I realized my issues and fixed them at the right moment.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nIf you are struggling with your money, look first at your expenses before trying to earn more.\n\n-   check your bills: are you wasting electricity, water, gas, etc.?\n-   check your transportation: can you walk or take the bus instead of the car?\n-   check your subscriptions: do you need Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Amazon Prime, etc.?\n-   check your shopping: do you need new clothes, new accessories, new devices, etc.?\n\nThe list continues but, in summary, adopt a minimalistic lifestyle. Think twice before clicking the buy button.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

So, what is this? Glad you asked. This is the Wyckoff Method. In Layman’s terms:\n\n\u003E The Wyckoff Method is a method of determining when a market is manipulated by big guys — “Composite man” — into their advantage.\n\nYou read right, manipulated. The method was developed for stocks, but it can be applied to any market, including our new crypto market.\n\nThe Wyckoff method describes two chart patterns of manipulation, which can predict long-term movement: **distribution and accumulation**.\n\nIn the distribution pattern, big guys (“Whales”, “the Composite man”, etc.) sell their shares and manipulate the market into a downtrend.\n\nIn the accumulation phase, big guys buy as many cheap shares as possible and then manipulate the market into an uptrend\n\nIn the crypto arena, Bitcoin is the market mover. Where Bitcoin goes, the market eventually flows. Thus, by looking at the Bitcoin 1D chart, we see almost perfectly a **Wyckoff distribution** chart pattern. More about the Wyckoff method [here](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![Wyckoff Distribution](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F800\u002F0*cf6ZyDFaCrld-Q8i.png)\n\nIf we look at the Bitcoin chart and the Wyckoff distribution schematic, they sure look pretty much the same.\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I sold everything with the intent to buy back at 30K or less. Of course, I may be wrong, nothing is certain. In this case, I will buy back in at 43k, after the 42k resistance is broken.\n\nNow, I won’t buy only Bitcoin. As I said, everything goes down sooner or later following Bitcoin, as we saw in May and along the years.\n\nThe last time I saw a [bearish indicator or pattern](https:\u002F\u002Frazvantomegea.medium.com\u002Fafter-the-crash-this-bitcoin-indicator-knew-it-all-along-439633cea698) and didn’t follow the plan, I lost half my money (all my profit). I won’t make that mistake again.\n\nIf I am wrong, then we are currently already in the Wyckoff accumulation phase and we will go to the moon (100k) sooner. I think we will go to 30K one last time and then go up.\n\n### Takeaway\n\nThe takeaway is to be prepared for the crypto market going down another 10–20%. What you do in this scenario is up to you. I am no financial adviser and cannot recommend you do anything.\n\nHowever, I am presenting what I am doing in this case. I sold everything and waiting to buy the dip (30k) or buying again when we have a stronger uptrend (42k+).\n\nFurthermore, you should always be prepared for a market crash by analyzing the greed and having an exit strategy.

These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment.

I took the courses from  [XTB](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade\u002Ftrading-academy)  and got familiar with charts, patterns, and indicators.\r\n\r\nThus, I started trading in the demo account and made some profits, so I deposited money in a real account and started taking action. Everything went fine until I started losing money; lots of money.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why can’t I make easy money as others do? Fuck trading! It is all a scheme.” That was my attitude towards trading until I realized my mistakes and started making profits.\r\n\r\n**These lessons cost me $5000 plus $1000 lost in Bitcoin**, but I am sharing them with you for free, you lucky you. Ok, let’s see my mistakes.\r\n\r\n# Overexposed\r\n\r\nI  **traded with the money I was not comfortable with losing**. All my monthly savings were put into trading and it became like an addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter losing money I put money again with the hope I can compensate for my losses. Sound like gambling to me, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI was constantly checking the trading app, very stressed and panic when seeing everything in red. I didn’t know what I was doing. This leads us to my second mistake.\r\n\r\n# No strategy & research\r\n\r\nMy strategy was to make money, that’s it. I never implemented a backtested strategy for all 3 possible scenarios of a trend (up, down, sideways). If the candle was green buy; otherwise sell. Cool right?\r\n\r\nWell, lucky for you I have a good article on a simple, yet a profitable backtested strategy that you can apply on any market.\r\n\r\nBefore trading or investing, have a plan and make sure you understand what you are putting your money into.  **Technical analysis (trading) without fundamental analysis is bullshit**  in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple and I will give you Bitcoin as an example. All the charts and indicators indicate strong buy, but the bull market cycle is over or Elon Musk makes another tweet. The indicators are useless in this case.\r\n\r\nAnother example is buying Tesla just because the trend is going up and the oscillators say not overbought, but not considering the P\u002FE ratio of 800 (extremely overpriced).\r\n\r\n# Not diversified enough\r\n\r\nYou know that saying:  **“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”**. I didn’t know that and put too much money into a single deal which was also not a well-researched deal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb for diversification, but you can for sure over diversify. The main idea is to  **choose different markets**  (stocks, commodities, real estate, crypto, etc.) and  **buy different assets.**\r\n\r\nNow, the way I do it is by looking at the cycles and fundamental indicators. For instance, I am more invested in crypto and commodities, than stocks and real estate.\r\n\r\nThis is because I know hyperinflation is coming, I know we are in a crypto bull market, and I know real estate and stocks are overpriced. Again, I am not just a trader, but also an investor (technical & fundamental analysis).\r\n\r\nAlso, in crypto, I choose only the best from the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, and not buying tens of crypto assets. I did that and it is a wrong approach.\r\n\r\nOk, hope everything makes sense. Let’ move to the next big mistake I made.\r\n\r\n# Over-leveraged\r\n\r\nI used  [leverage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Fterms\u002Fl\u002Fleverage.asp)  without understanding it fully. The problem with leverage is that in case the market moves in the opposite direction, you are at risk of liquidation. Not only that but not using a stop loss… haha… awful shit can happen as it did to me.\r\n\r\nLeverage is the reason I lost so much money (for me, an average mortal).  **Leverage amplified my lack of knowledge, strategy, experience, and diversification.**\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what leverage is, let me explain it simply like this:  **your investment (or %price move) multiplied by a ratio**. In other words, if a market has a leverage of 1:2 (2x), that means you are doubling the price change.\r\n\r\nIf the price goes up 5%, the leverage amplifies and you are winning a 10%. Same story if the price goes down. You are borrowing money for investing. $100 invested in a 1:2 leveraged asset, is equal to $200 invested.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is, if you are a beginner or don’t understand how to use leverage, do not ever use it. The risk is not worth it.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nThe last mistake, but not the least is I let my emotions control my trading and investing decisions. Of course, no strategy, over-invested, not diversified, leverage, all these amplified my emotions.\r\n\r\n**Investing and trading must be 100% analytical**; with no emotions and gut feelings. If you can automate your trading strategy, it is awesome. Otherwise, know your plan and stick to it no matter what.\r\n\r\nRemember that  **no indicator, strategy, analysis, whatever are 100% guaranteed**  to offer you profits. It is a delusion most beginners like me had.\r\n\r\nWe are working with probabilities, and the idea is to increase the likelihood of ending up in profit.\r\n\r\n\u003E A backtested strategy, with the right amount of investment, with enough diversification, without the risk of being liquidated, with patience, and no emotions will make you an unstoppable investor and trader.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
