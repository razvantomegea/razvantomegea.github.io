However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n### Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n### Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fyou-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n### Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n### A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n### Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n### Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fmy-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n### A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n### Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n### Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n### Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

This app is the merge of my two passions and skills.\n\n**Why make something that already exists?** The truth is, it doesn’t. You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up.

Think about the hustle.\n\n### Bodily app\n\n[The Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) is an all-in-one lifestyle tracker and you can find it online. What makes Bodily unique is that it has **all the health and fitness trackers** in one app.\n\nYou also don’t need to download anything, so you can use it in your browser from any device and it is quite fast.\n\nIn the future, Bodily will be a **health and fitness social media**, similar to Strava, but with more features.\n\nThink about it, **what if you had a health and fitness profile online where your friends and your doctor can easily see your lifestyle**? Some kind of health and fitness page, which can also be private. That’s the goal of Bodily.\n\nFor now, I managed to implement only regular manual tracking, with minimal automation to speed up the process. For me, it takes an average of **2 minutes per day to track everything**. Is it a lot? Leave a comment.\n\nCurrently, you can track your **body composition, diet plan, exercise plan, sleep schedule, water intake, blood lipids, and blood glucose.** More biomarker trackers will come.\n\nYou can also **create workouts using existing workout exercises** classified by muscle groups, equipment, exercise type, and more.\nYou can use the app to **search for thousands of recipes**, using filters like diet, calorie content, cuisine, macronutrient content, and more.\n\nThe app has a [YouTube channel,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCkho_iFnebE-km74uhG3Egw) [Facebook page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fbodilyapp), and [Instagram page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), on which you can currently find tutorials for tracking your water intake, and diet plan. More tutorials and posts will come.\n\n### Pricing\n\nOf course, the **app is not free**. You have a 30-day trial, and then it will be 2 EUR\u002Fmonth. It is not expensive, nor cheap. It is the regular price of memberships out there.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

This caused me to catch a virus and get sick. I had no desire to live my life, no desire to eat, and no smell or taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was to lie in bed and watch “House of Cards”.\r\nNow, you may be thinking that I had corona. No, I did not, because I tested myself with the RT-PCR test and it was negative. You are not the only one who believes this, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought I had corona, just because I had the common cold symptoms. It is a little frustrating how this fear entered into our brains. We can no longer have a simple cold without intriguing someone and panicking.\r\nThe symptoms of corona are 100% similar to the common cold and it is so easy to confuse them. I had 90% of them. However, let’s not forget there are millions of viruses out there waiting to infect us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting symptom was the loss of smell and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t have taste or smell is that I was congested. Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives. After my energy and smell came back, I felt again the taste of food, and I had the desire to move again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started appreciating just being able to taste my food and coffee. I was also happy I didn’t have to be quarantined for 14 days just when good weather starter to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness is good sometimes because it forces us to stop, meditate, and appreciate the little things more.

It is false for many reasons, one of which is that we are different.\r\n\r\nBut why do we need to sleep in the first place?\r\n\r\nLet us skip the science for a second and put common sense on the table. Are you feeling better and more productive after a good night’s sleep? Are you feeling like a mess after a poor sleep or when you are sleep-deprived?\r\n\r\nWhen I have a good sleep, I feel I can conquer the world. On the contrary, I feel like a teenage girl during her period after a poor sleep.\r\n\r\nDespite feeling good, sleep helps us:\r\n\r\n-   lower our general body inflammation;\r\n-   making better decisions during the day, including to eat the right food and exercise;\r\n-   increase our libido;\r\n-   boost our immunity;\r\n-   boost general performance;\r\n-   manage stress.\r\n\r\nMore information about sleep benefits [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sleep.org\u002Fsleep-science\u002F), and [here](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F).\r\n\r\n## 1. Quality over quantity\r\n\r\nIt is more important to get good quality sleep than a good quantity of sleep. There were times in my life in which I slept seven hours and a half per night and was full of energy and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nFrankly, there were other periods when I slept for twelve hours and was still tired. The reason for this is I changed my diet and started eating fatty foods and too many calories.\r\n\r\nFocusing on sleep duration changes our focus from what matters: deep sleep. Sleep was four stages: awake, light, non-REM (deep), and REM. The deep sleep phase is most important because our body heals in that period.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get the deep sleep we need is by helping our body know when to produce melatonin, the sleep-cycle hormone, before bed.\r\n\r\n-   go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time most of the days;\r\n-   avoid blue and cold light one hour before bed. Use f.lux or iris apps on your laptop and phones;\r\n-   avoid caffeine after lunch;\r\n-   keep the bedroom dark and cool (\u003C 20 degrees Celsius);\r\n-   have a sleep supplement or drink some tea with relaxing herbs.\r\n\r\nSleep is also cumulative. For instance, if you need six hours of sleep, you can get them by taking four naps of one hour and a half. There is also a sleep method called Uberman Sleep Cycle that advocates 6–8 equidistant 20-minute naps.\r\n\r\n## 2. Age\r\n\r\nAge influences how much sleep we need. The younger we are, the more (deep) sleep we need.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F0*5U3eXUOgTmus-zZg)\r\n\r\n[Credit](https:\u002F\u002Fstartsleeping.org\u002Fsleep-needs\u002F)\r\n\r\n## 3. Physical and intellectual activities\r\n\r\nA sedentary person or a person who does not do something during the day cannot have the same sleep needs as an athlete or a student who studies hard.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense that the more activities we do, both physical or intellectual, the more deep sleep we need.\r\n\r\n## 4. Genetics\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is a light sleeper. Any small noise or movement wakes her up, and she hardly falls asleep. Her father, on the contrary, sleeps like a bear in any place and at any time. I am in the middle.\r\n\r\nGenetics influences sleep, regardless of the lifestyle. Of course, lifestyle can help a lot, and we are not doomed to our genetic predispositions.\r\n\r\nSome persons sleep six hours and are fully charged, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, maybe because they have more deep sleep than others.\r\n\r\nI need 9 hours of sleep to be 100% charged. Of course, I have a regular sleep schedule and respect some of the points mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I did, and I lost 90% of the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI bought AAKG, HMB, Glutamine, L-Carnitine, Fat burners, Citrulline Malate, Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Testosterone Boosters, Create, Protein powders, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe irony is that I was in one of the worst shapes of my life. With all the popular supplements in my house, I wasn't going up, but down. I was losing a lot of money as well. I said to myself that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started cutting out supplements one by one and focused more on the basics. I saw more results than ever.\r\n\r\n-   moderate and consistent caloric deficit for fat loss with low calorie, nutrient-dense foods;\r\n-   correct (slow movements, proper form, progressive overload) training with fewer sessions of strength training;\r\n-   good sleep and resting;\r\n-   lots of water.\r\n\r\nThese four elements transformed my body and life. I had more money, more time, more flexibility, more results. The only supplements that remained were krill oil, multivitamins, and minerals, creatine, and protein powders.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the article [The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle), I wrote that the best supplements for muscle building are Creatine and Protein powders, along with krill oil (or fish oil) and multivitamins and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, I realized that with a balanced diet that included all food groups, primarily focusing on vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meats, I no longer need any supplements. I have all the nutrients I need from food: amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only time I take supplements, like protein powder and multivitamins and minerals, is when I travel or leave home and I no longer eat my foods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSide note: I take some supplements for health purposes only (immunity and detox), and not for fitness purposes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe can see that less is more strikes again. We don't need all the stuff the media tells us. If we stick to the basics in everything and accept there are no shortcuts to success, we will achieve all our goals in simple and maybe easy ways than we thought.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1625898507",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:e,links:[{url:f,icon:"mdi-heart",title:c},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:"HEALTH","mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:{},articles:g,searchQuery:b,"mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:g,isSearching:e}},serverRendered:true,routePath:f,config:{}}}("Razvan Tomegea","","Health","Health, Fitness",false,"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",Array(6)));
