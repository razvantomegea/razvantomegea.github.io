For what is worth, I think most of them are bullshit.\n\nI am also talking about spot reduction. Does any of the ads: “10-minute Ab Workout To Melt Belly Fat” or “Best Exercises For Thin Legs” ring a bell? Trust me; spot reduction is a myth.\n\nThe body decides based on hormones and genetics where to store and from where to burn fat. It’s out of our control.\n\nThe only thing we can do is manage our calories and ensure we burn more than we consume — or consume less than we burn.\n\nWe will analyze the most popular exercise routines and see which burns the most calories (fat).\n\n### Strength training\n\nI am sorry to break your bubble, but strength training burns the least amount of calories. Strength training is not for burning fat necessarily, but for improving body composition by increasing contractile tissue.\n\nDepending on your body weight, age, and gender, you may burn around (+\u002F- 100kcal) 300 kcal per hour of strength training. We are excluding any form of cardio from this.\n\nAlso, during that hour of training, we are doing it intensely with a maximum of 1–2 minutes rest between sets and reps (on the timer).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*TcIKZFBwB-mQaJvpTGCZ4Q.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nStrength training is a high-intensity interval training regimen and cannot be maintained for long periods. It has a high impact on the nervous system, muscular system, and cardiovascular system.\n\nIf someone works out for more than one and a half hours, he’s either wasting time, either doing some cardio, either is on PEDs.\n\nAccording to our human physiology, this form of exercise relies on glycogen and blood glucose for energy. Body fat is almost untouched during the session.\n\nAlso, building more muscle will increase your resting metabolic rate, which means you will burn more calories doing nothing. It’s kind of an investment.\n\nCombine this knowledge with the fact that strength training burns few calories, for sure strength training is not for fat loss, but muscle building and general health and wellbeing.\n\n### Running\n\nRunning is medium to high intensity aerobic exercise, depending on the pace. This type of exercise burn the most amount of energy per hour, some of it (25%) coming from body fat during the session.\n\nIt is for this reasons why most people choose running for fat loss. Aerobic exercise relies mostly on body fat for energy and it also burns a lot of calories.\n\nRunning for one hour at 8 miles per hour (12 km\u002Fh) burns around 1000 kcal (+\u002F- 200 kcal). It is 3 times more than strength training. Even running for 30 minutes burns more than strength training.\n\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*EolPGk2S9_Zt1X_ah9kzqQ.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nHowever, running alone for long periods of times may also burn muscle mass as it is catabolic and doesn’t stimulate muscle growth. If you don’t believe me, look at all the runners (not sprinters) out there and decide for yourself.\n\nRunning is also taxing your cardiovascular and nervous system and cannot be performed daily. I found running fun from time to time, but cannot do it more than once or twice per week.\n\nIn conclusion, running burns the most amount of calories, improves the cardiovascular system, but cannot be done often.\n\n### Walking\n\nWalking is my favorite form of exercise. I wrote an article about walking [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4). I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.\n\nI like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.\n\nWalking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+\u002F- 100 kcal).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nIt is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.\n\nWith all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.\n\n-   strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;\n-   running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;\n-   walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.\n\nThe winner is walking because of the consistency. Slow, long-term consistent progress will always beat fat, short-term progress.\n\nHowever, walking does not improves any muscle, neither skeletal, nor cardiovascular. Make no mistake, strength training and running may not burn more calories, but they do offer more health and fitness benefits than walking.\n\nIn my opinion, all three forms of exercise must be incorporated and combined in ones lifestyle for health and fitness purposes.\n\nI do include them, however I must work on my running (medium intensity aerobic exercise) routine, as I skip it because it makes me very tired.\n\n**What are your favorite exercises?

In other words, **eat every three hours**.\n\nWhat if I told you this is **the biggest bull-shit and stupidity we have ever heard and made** since our human evolution?\n\nThink about it; we are the only species on the planet that eat every two or three hours per day. Every **other species eats and stops for hours or days**.\n\nOk, maybe herbivores eat all day, but we are not herbivores. Even they fast during the winter when there are no more leaves or grasses.\n\n**Fasting is a natural process** with many benefits, and we are preventing stealing these benefits from our bodies.\n\n### Storytime\n\nI started to learn how to eat correctly in 2005 when I went to the doctor because **I was too fat**. He told me that a balanced diet should include three meals a day and two snacks.\n\nWell, I lost weight, but not with advice. I started doing **intermittent fasting without even knowing** about it. Of course, I also changed what I ate, not only how I ate.\n\nI also started playing sports — handball. I had training at 8:00 a.m., and I couldn’t eat in the morning because I would throw up during the practice because of the intensity. So, I skipped breakfast and ate when I got back home.\n\nMy first meal was at 10:30–11:00 a.m.. I also ate at school and 7:00–8:00 p.m. So, **I was fasting for 14–16 hours** without even knowing it at 11 years old. Of course, I was **also in a caloric deficit**.\n\nAs a result, I lost 20kg in 2 years. I also had a 6-pack without doing crunches.\n\n### The Fitness Industry Corrupted Me\n\nAfter years, I started going to the gym and reading fitness blogs. I read that to build muscle and boost metabolism, you need to **eat every 2–3 hours. Otherwise, muscles won’t grow but shrink.**\n\nI followed this advice for years, and I **did not have a life**. Everywhere I want I had to plan to be exactly after my last meal. In other cases, I needed to have a meal packed with me all the time. It was a pain in the ass.\n\n**I was living to eat, not eating to live.** Fitness and food controlled my life.\n\nAfter a while, I started to learn about human physiology and hormones. I came across a doctor who said we were skipping breakfast and fasting and explained why. I was interested, so I started to learn more.\n\nI learned about fasting and its benefits to health and fitness, so I applied it to my lifestyle. It was a total failure. Why? Because I didn’t track my calories. I learned that **fasting without being in a caloric deficit does not affect fat loss**.\n\nIn the end, the best approach to fat loss for me was intermittent fasting combine with caloric deficit or maintenance.\n\n### Why intermittent fasting?\n\nFasting for at least sixteen hours puts the body into a state of lipolysis, ketosis, and cellular autophagy. In other words, you enter **fat-burning and healing mode**.\n\nIn more detail, fasting can improve biomarkers, have anti-aging benefits, have metabolic benefits[[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fintermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156)[[2]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC5783752\u002F), and prevent cancer[[3]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002Fpmc\u002Farticles\u002FPMC6938162\u002F). The last one is obvious because of cellular autophagy.\n\nThere are many other benefits if you begin to search for research studies on this topic. In Layman’s terms, **fasting heals the body and triggers fat-burning mode.**\n\n### Fasting is not for every one\n\nOf course, fasting is not for everyone. If you are pregnant, a child below ten years old, or have medical issues, then fasting may not be for you.\n\nYou should consult your doctor before starting any routine.\n\n### How I fast\n\nI fast between 8:00–9:00 p.m. until 12:00–1:00 p.m. I also exercise on an empty stomach (cardio o strength training) because **fasting does not burn muscle**[[5]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=teQIaU6wp2o&t=7s).\n\nDuring my fast, I drink only water, herbal tea, and black coffee, without milk or sweeteners.\n\nSometimes, I fast for 24 hours, sometimes for 14. Sometimes I skip fasting because of some events. However, I fast 16 hours 6 times per week.\n\nEver since I started to fast, I feel free, and I control my weight and lifestyle, not the other way around.\n\n### References\n\n1.

However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n### Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n### Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fyou-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n### Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n### A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n### Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n### Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fthe-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fmy-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n### A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n### Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n### Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n### Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

This app is the merge of my two passions and skills.\n\n**Why make something that already exists?** The truth is, it doesn’t. You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up. What if you change your phone operating system? What if you want to use the apps on your PC? Think about the hustle.\n\n### Bodily app\n\n[The Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) is an all-in-one lifestyle tracker and you can find it online.

Some kind of health and fitness page, which can also be private. That’s the goal of Bodily.\n\nFor now, I managed to implement only regular manual tracking, with minimal automation to speed up the process. For me, it takes an average of **2 minutes per day to track everything**. Is it a lot? Leave a comment.\n\nCurrently, you can track your **body composition, diet plan, exercise plan, sleep schedule, water intake, blood lipids, and blood glucose.** More biomarker trackers will come.\n\nYou can also **create workouts using existing workout exercises** classified by muscle groups, equipment, exercise type, and more.\nYou can use the app to **search for thousands of recipes**, using filters like diet, calorie content, cuisine, macronutrient content, and more.\n\nThe app has a [YouTube channel,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCkho_iFnebE-km74uhG3Egw) [Facebook page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fbodilyapp), and [Instagram page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), on which you can currently find tutorials for tracking your water intake, and diet plan. More tutorials and posts will come.\n\n### Pricing\n\nOf course, the **app is not free**. You have a 30-day trial, and then it will be 2 EUR\u002Fmonth. It is not expensive, nor cheap. It is the regular price of memberships out there.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it a **Thumbs up and Share it** to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.\r\n\r\nThus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.\r\n\r\n### How and why the muscle grows?\r\n\r\nIn nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.\r\n\r\n\u003E The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.\r\n\r\nSimple, right?\r\n\r\nIt is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.\r\n\r\n### Workout structure\r\n\r\nYour workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only **compound movements** (multiple muscle groups per movement).\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to **avoid machines**, we will be using **only free weights and\u002For resistance bands**. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the exercises:\r\n\r\n-   chest: **bench press and incline bench press** (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);\r\n-   back: **pull-ups\u002Fchin-ups\u002Fpull-downs and rows**;\r\n-   legs: **squats and deadlifts** (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol\u002FBulgarian\u002Fsplit squats);\r\n-   shoulders: **shoulder press and lateral raises**;\r\n-   biceps: **curls**;\r\n-   triceps: **dips, push-downs, and\u002For skull crushers**;\r\n-   (optional) calves: calve raises**;**\r\n-   (optional) abs: leg raises.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.\r\n\r\n### Exercise execution\r\n\r\nHow we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.\r\n\r\nEach exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on **6–10 challenging reps**, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (**1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric**.)\r\n\r\nLet’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:\r\n\r\n-   when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);\r\n-   you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;\r\n-   when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).\r\n\r\nWe will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.\r\n\r\nFor the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.\r\n\r\n### Workout sessions\r\n\r\nYou can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:\r\n\r\n-   **push\u002Fpull\u002Flegs** (Monday to Saturday);\r\n-   **upper\u002Flower** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);\r\n-   **full-body** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n\r\nI do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.\r\n\r\n### Diet and sleep\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. **Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic**.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, **lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs & egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits**.\r\n\r\nIf you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You **don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements** unless you have money to spare.\r\n\r\nFor sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday**, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.\r\n\r\nI found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me. You can try it and experiment with your body if you like. The goal was to share my experience and knowledge with you and eliminate the noise from the fitness industry.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n\r\nWe all dream of being like superheroes (Thor, Captain America, Superman, Batman, etc.) or like our favorite Instagram influencer. However, we have been fed the delusion of the perfect body.\r\n\r\n\u003E 90% of the superhero movie actors and fitness influencers are not natural and have great genetics.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be disappointed when we don’t become like them and we think that the naturally fit (imperfect) body is not fit at all. Everyone has a different version of fitness.\r\n\r\nDon’t compare yourself with others, but with yourself from the past. If you are making progress, that’s all that matters. Health and fitness is a marathon — a journey and a lifestyle — not a sprint.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Il6rHJfkWBI5eYpFyZN2ng.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\u003E 12–14% body fat year round (no editing and not good lightning)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
