It was in my character to try to please people because of low self-esteem and the need for validation. It all goes down to my past, but that is another story. I learned through trial and error that I need to change my attitude.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am Iron Man. I am joking (Iron Man reference). The truth is, **nice guys are not that nice**. Nice guys have expectations; they are needy. Nice guys give to receive and keep count of everything they do. Their **self-identity and self-respect depend on others'** opinions and validations. Nice guys want to please with the hope that people around will appreciate them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIs it just me, or is it pathetic? Maybe you have friends around who are people pleasers and always seem awkward. It makes sense to me why, for a while, people didn't want to be around me, especially girls. Back then, my mind could not understand this. How can a girl or woman say: \"You're so nice!\" and at the same time: \"but I see you as a friend\" and run with the asshole that doesn't give a shit about her?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt all goes back to the primal brain. **Females are programmed to sick the alpha male, the fittest male, to pass their genes to the offspring.** The alpha male was the biggest and strongest from a physical standpoint. It made sense because females needed protection and leadership in a dangerous environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe are not that different from the primal human because our brain is like an onion: it adds new layers of gray matter, but the core brain remains. Thus, the first **reptilian brain focused on survival (food, water, shelter, reproduction) is still there.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, the **strongest male is the strongest from a mental and emotional standpoint.** It makes sense because women need emotional and psychological support. Between the nice guy and bad boy, the bad boy is the winner from this perspective.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBad boys have **self-respect and a strong knowledge of who they are.** They **know what they want** in life and go after it. They are **well on their own** because their **self-identity and self-esteem are independent of others**. They are always themselves around others and without inhibitions. Bad boys **put themselves first** before others, have **high self-confidence and self-control**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSee the pattern here? Nice guys are the exact opposite. Now, bad boys have some negative traits: they **tend to be arrogant, self-centered, and with little empathy**. Bad boys may use people for their self-interest. It is why bad boys don't care about women, because it is not their goal. Also, very important, **bad boys don't focus on the little things**. In other words, they **don't give a shit about anything but themselves**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRemember the Tony Stark from Iron Man reference in the beginning? Well, Tony Stark, in the beginning, was a bad boy - a player - but he changed and realized the qualities of a superhero.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are not aware of their primal desires and **cannot explain why they are sexually attracted to the guy who doesn't give a shit about her**. Women also test their man throughout their life to check if he is still a man and can resist under pressure or if he is the real deal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you don't have to be either of them, as they are both extremes. What you need to be is a real man and not just any man, but your version of a real man.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**A real man is a merge between a nice guy and a bad boy**. A real man has the good qualities of the bad boy (confidence, goals, self-control, independence, courage, emotional and psychological stability), and the good qualities of the nice guy: empathy, self-less, compassion, and love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA real man is like a superhero, but without the cape and the mutant powers: he uses his qualities to help others without receiving back, is courageous and responsible. He is an example for others.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I started to learn how to be a man, I put on a fake bad boy mask. It was when I began dating my girlfriend, but she felt I was not myself. She even told me: \"I like you better now (yourself) than in the beginning\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, nice guys are not themselves; they put masks because they are not comfortable with who they are. **You don't have to be a bad boy if it is not in your genes**, because it is not natural for you. Just be yourself but with some improvements.\r\n\r\n# Takeaways\r\n\r\n-   believe in yourself;\r\n-   don't give to receive;\r\n-   don't care what others think about you unless they give you constructive advice;\r\n-   develop self-control and inner toughness;\r\n-   don't expect validation from others;\r\n-   have the courage to say what you feel and think;\r\n-   be responsible for your actions and make decisions;\r\n-   make yourself a priority, but don't hurt people around you in the process;\r\n-   ignore the little things and don't overanalyze;\r\n-   learn from your mistakes and move on;\r\n-   grow some b**ls and harden your spine.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"}]}],["articles\u002FREAD_ARTICLE",{type:"READ_ARTICLE",id:a}],["layout\u002FSET_PAGE_TITLE",{type:"SET_PAGE_TITLE",pageTitle:b}]]}}("why-bad-boys-end-up-with-the-girl-and-how-to-be-better","Why Bad Boys End Up With The Girl And How To BeÂ Better")));
