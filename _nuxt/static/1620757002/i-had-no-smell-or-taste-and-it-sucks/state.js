This caused me to catch a virus and get sick. I had no desire to live my life, no desire to eat, and no smell or taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to do was to lie in bed and watch “House of Cards”.\r\nNow, you may be thinking that I had corona. No, I did not, because I tested myself with the RT-PCR test and it was negative. You are not the only one who believes this, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody thought I had corona, just because I had the common cold symptoms. It is a little frustrating how this fear entered into our brains. We can no longer have a simple cold without intriguing someone and panicking.\r\nThe symptoms of corona are 100% similar to the common cold and it is so easy to confuse them. I had 90% of them. However, let’s not forget there are millions of viruses out there waiting to infect us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting symptom was the loss of smell and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn’t have taste or smell is that I was congested. Smell and taste are correlated. I felt what was salty, sweet, sour, or bitter, but I couldn’t feel the flavor. I had to eat just for hunger, not for taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis experience made me realize again how important health and wellbeing are to our lives. After my energy and smell came back, I felt again the taste of food, and I had the desire to move again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started appreciating just being able to taste my food and coffee. I was also happy I didn’t have to be quarantined for 14 days just when good weather starter to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness is good sometimes because it forces us to stop, meditate, and appreciate the little things more. I also learned I am not invincible just because I am young and have a balanced lifestyle. We learn only through our pain, unfortunately.";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1620757002",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:"Fitness"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fi-had-no-smell-or-taste-and-it-sucks",config:{}}}(false,"Health","I Had No Smell Or Taste And It Sucks",{},Array(1)));
