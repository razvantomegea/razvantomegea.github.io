This app is the merge of my two passions and skills.\n\n**Why make something that already exists?** The truth is, it doesn’t. You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up. What if you change your phone operating system? What if you want to use the apps on your PC? Think about the hustle.\n\n### Bodily app\n\n[The Bodily app](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app) is an all-in-one lifestyle tracker and you can find it online. What makes Bodily unique is that it has **all the health and fitness trackers** in one app.\n\nYou also don’t need to download anything, so you can use it in your browser from any device and it is quite fast.\n\nIn the future, Bodily will be a **health and fitness social media**, similar to Strava, but with more features.\n\nThink about it, **what if you had a health and fitness profile online where your friends and your doctor can easily see your lifestyle**? Some kind of health and fitness page, which can also be private. That’s the goal of Bodily.\n\nFor now, I managed to implement only regular manual tracking, with minimal automation to speed up the process. For me, it takes an average of **2 minutes per day to track everything**. Is it a lot? Leave a comment.\n\nCurrently, you can track your **body composition, diet plan, exercise plan, sleep schedule, water intake, blood lipids, and blood glucose.** More biomarker trackers will come.\n\nYou can also **create workouts using existing workout exercises** classified by muscle groups, equipment, exercise type, and more.\nYou can use the app to **search for thousands of recipes**, using filters like diet, calorie content, cuisine, macronutrient content, and more.\n\nThe app has a [YouTube channel,](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCkho_iFnebE-km74uhG3Egw) [Facebook page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fbodilyapp), and [Instagram page](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fbodily.app\u002F), on which you can currently find tutorials for tracking your water intake, and diet plan. More tutorials and posts will come.\n\n### Pricing\n\nOf course, the **app is not free**. You have a 30-day trial, and then it will be 2 EUR\u002Fmonth. It is not expensive, nor cheap. It is the regular price of memberships out there.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.\r\n\r\nThus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.\r\n\r\n### How and why the muscle grows?\r\n\r\nIn nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.\r\n\r\n\u003E The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.\r\n\r\nSimple, right?\r\n\r\nIt is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.\r\n\r\n### Workout structure\r\n\r\nYour workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only **compound movements** (multiple muscle groups per movement).\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to **avoid machines**, we will be using **only free weights and\u002For resistance bands**. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the exercises:\r\n\r\n-   chest: **bench press and incline bench press** (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);\r\n-   back: **pull-ups\u002Fchin-ups\u002Fpull-downs and rows**;\r\n-   legs: **squats and deadlifts** (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol\u002FBulgarian\u002Fsplit squats);\r\n-   shoulders: **shoulder press and lateral raises**;\r\n-   biceps: **curls**;\r\n-   triceps: **dips, push-downs, and\u002For skull crushers**;\r\n-   (optional) calves: calve raises**;**\r\n-   (optional) abs: leg raises.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.\r\n\r\n### Exercise execution\r\n\r\nHow we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.\r\n\r\nEach exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on **6–10 challenging reps**, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (**1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric**.)\r\n\r\nLet’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:\r\n\r\n-   when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);\r\n-   you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;\r\n-   when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).\r\n\r\nWe will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.\r\n\r\nFor the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.\r\n\r\n### Workout sessions\r\n\r\nYou can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:\r\n\r\n-   **push\u002Fpull\u002Flegs** (Monday to Saturday);\r\n-   **upper\u002Flower** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);\r\n-   **full-body** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n\r\nI do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.\r\n\r\n### Diet and sleep\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. **Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic**.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, **lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs & egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits**.\r\n\r\nIf you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You **don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements** unless you have money to spare.\r\n\r\nFor sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday**, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.\r\n\r\nI found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me. You can try it and experiment with your body if you like. The goal was to share my experience and knowledge with you and eliminate the noise from the fitness industry.\r\n\r\n### Expectations\r\n\r\nWe all dream of being like superheroes (Thor, Captain America, Superman, Batman, etc.) or like our favorite Instagram influencer. However, we have been fed the delusion of the perfect body.\r\n\r\n\u003E 90% of the superhero movie actors and fitness influencers are not natural and have great genetics.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be disappointed when we don’t become like them and we think that the naturally fit (imperfect) body is not fit at all. Everyone has a different version of fitness.\r\n\r\nDon’t compare yourself with others, but with yourself from the past. If you are making progress, that’s all that matters. Health and fitness is a marathon — a journey and a lifestyle — not a sprint.\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Il6rHJfkWBI5eYpFyZN2ng.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\u003E 12–14% body fat year round (no editing and not good lightning)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it some claps and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

Always listen or read, but do your research afterward.\r\n\r\nWhat I am writing is from my own experience and research. I am trying to sell nothing. I struggled with losing body fat in a both simple — but hard — and easy — but complicated and expensive — manner.\r\n\r\nI have been following Greg Doucette, AthleanX, Jeff Nippard, and Vitruvian physique on YouTube, plus reading BodyRecomposition’s [“Fat Loss Fundamentals”](https:\u002F\u002Fbodyrecomposition.com\u002Ffat-loss\u002F4-fat-loss-fundamentals), plus my own experience, and found the same principles.\r\n\r\n\u003E More calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat gain, whereas fewer calories from food than burned results in weight\u002Ffat loss.\r\n\r\nNow, on paper, it is very simple, but we don’t live on paper. We have hormones that dictate our hunger and satiety which may or may not helps us in our fat loss journey.\r\n\r\nSome people are satisfied and stay full for longer periods with less food, whereas others (like me) need a lot of food to be full. It’s genetics and it sucks. I need to eat 3kg of food per day to be full. Imagine that!\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*i-ThPpnYX9QZCDvmC7Q7Ow.jpeg)\r\n\r\n[Meals from Bodily on the day of this writing](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002FHW8fZXHoS8eAFH5ejbwr9OZJsA62\u002Fdiet\u002F2021-04-04)\r\n\r\nThe hunger hormones also change depending on your lifestyle. Poor sleep, alcohol, stress, sugar, low fiber, and protein diet, etc. make us hungrier and less full.\r\n\r\nWe can force ourselves to eat in a calorie deficit for the short term through calorie counting, but in the long term, we will fail. We may also not be able to track always everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, [lifestyle tracking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F) is required in the beginning to increase awareness of how much energy you burn through different exercises, how much energy, and how many nutrients different foods have.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to make the process as enjoyable as possible, because it is a life-long process. If you don’t see it this way, you shouldn’t even consider it.\r\n\r\nEnough chit-chat; let’s get to business!\r\n\r\n### The technical\r\n\r\n1.  Know how much you burn at rest (resting metabolic rate);\r\n2.  Know how much you burn through physical movement;\r\n3.  Know how much you eat weekly;\r\n4.  Be in a 10% weekly caloric deficit.\r\n\r\nTo know all of this, you can use [Bodily](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F). I use it to track my entire lifestyle and it does all the complex calculations for you.\r\n\r\nNow, to make the steps above easier and more natural, let’s see some further steps.\r\n\r\n### The natural\r\n\r\n1.  Eat foods low in calories and high in volume (high protein, fiber, and water content, and low-fat content);\r\n2.  Avoid trigger foods (foods you can’t stop from eating);\r\n3.  Get a good 7–9h sleep every night;\r\n4.  Drink a lot of water;\r\n5.  Eat before drinking alcohol, not after or while drinking;\r\n6.  Move every day.\r\n\r\nThese final steps are something you can do without any phone, just using your common sense. However, you still need in the beginning to track your sleep, movement and eating. After a period of practice, you will eyeball on everything.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

The idea was that the calories they provide are less than the calories required to digest them. In other words, they have negative calories. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n### Thermic effect of food\r\n\r\nYes, all foods require energy to be digested. The idea is called the “Thermic Effect of Food”. However, no food on the planet requires more calories to be digested than the calories it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you were to eat tree barks, which are pure undigestible fiber, you would not assimilate any calories, and burn energy through digestion.\r\n\r\nOn this topic, I saw a chick on the web who promotes eating flavored cotton balls to fill your stomach and lose weight. Is this smart?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the thermic effect of food is based on the protein and fiber content of food. The **more protein and fiber a food contains, the more energy the body consumes through digestion.**\r\n\r\nNot coincidently, **foods high in fiber and protein are also most filling**. Hence, you will eat fewer calories, and you will lose body fat. “Calories in and calories out” is the law of weight loss and weight gain.\r\n\r\n### No shortcuts\r\n\r\nMost people look for the magic pill and latest fad to lose body fat. I was one of them and I was constantly fooled by the most popular fitness articles and fad diets.\r\n\r\nUntil you accept that there is no shortcut and magic thing to fat loss, you will never lose body fat, only time and money. The **only thing you should focus on is your calories**, it’s that simple.\r\n\r\nThe “calories in” come only from your weekly food intake. “Calories out” however are more complex:\r\n\r\n-   ~ 65% resting metabolic rate (RMR);\r\n-   ~ 25% body movement;\r\n-   ~ 10% thermic effect of food.\r\n\r\nOf course, you also burn calories during cold exposure, brain processes, and others, but the major calorie burning comes from the three above. Anything else is a detail not worth considering.\r\n\r\nTo put the grapefruit and celery into this context, let’s say your maintenance calories during the day are 2500kcal. You are eating 2500kcal and 2 grapefruits worth 100kcal each, you will have 2700kcal on that day.\r\n\r\nConsidering 10kcal of those grapefruits are burned through digestion, you would still have 2690kcal on that day, hence 190kcal surplus. If you were to have this surplus daily, you will definitely gain weight with fat-burning grapefruits.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe tend to complicate things and look at the details that don’t make a difference: fat-burning foods, fat-burning supplements, EPOC, anabolic window, not eating after 06:00 pm, exercise on an empty stomach, carb cycling, meal timing, etc. Not worth the effort!\r\n\r\nTrack your calories, be in a realistic negative balance (burn more than you consume), and you will lose fat in the long run. To make the process easier, eat foods high in protein and fiber, and low in fat (low calorie-dense foods).\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

If you’re not new to my articles, you know I am repeating the statement above in every fitness article.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember the calorie equation to avoid being fooled by the latest diet or supplement. However, it is not that easy to achieve a caloric deficit as it is on paper.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will provide two hacks that helped me achieve a caloric deficit in the background.\r\n\r\n## Turn off the TV\r\n\r\nWatching movies or videos while eating distracts you from your body’s signals. You may end up eating mindlessly, even after being full. Turn off the TV, PC, phone, or any other media device when your eating.\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes on your plate and be more mindful of your body. Don’t eat until you are stuffed, but until you are satisfied. Avoiding electronics will help you better understand the difference between satisfied and stuffed.\r\n\r\n## Slow down\r\n\r\nIt [takes 20 minutes for our hunger hormones (CCK and leptin) to stabilize and make us no longer feel hungry](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.health.harvard.edu\u002Fblog\u002Fwhy-eating-slowly-may-help-you-feel-full-faster-20101019605). If you are eating in a rush, you will eat more food than you probably need in one seating.\r\n\r\nTake your time and enjoy your food. Look at eating like a meditation; an opportunity to relax and be with your own thoughts. If you are eating with your friends or family, it is a good opportunity to connect and socialize. Socializing while eating may help you slow down.\r\n\r\n## Use small plates\r\n\r\nPutting the same portion size on a small plate instead of a large plate creates the illusion of more food. It may help you eat less because you think you are eating more than you need.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is you may out less food in front of you. We usually overeat when we put too much food on the table because it just stands there in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
