It seems I was right. Bitcoin went down to 29K, and the crypto market followed.\n\nOf course, I bought Bitcoin at 29K and afterward at 34K, as you see in the chart. I also bought ETH at 1.9K.\n\n### The Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nBuying Bitcoin at 34K was a mistake because I thought, at first, that we are in **Phase C of the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic**. However, a more careful chart analysis revealed that we are most probably — not for sure — in **Phase B**.\n\nIn my previous article, I said that we are about to end the **Wyckoff Distribution Schematic,** and it seems we did, probably sooner than I saw. We can easily see that the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic has begun, and we are in the middle of it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the **Wyckoff Method,** read my [previous article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fhow-to-prepare-for-the-next-bitcoin-correction-with-the-wyckoff-method) or go directly to the [source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*C4HuCEj_xSB-bpas8-ytjw.png)\n\n[Source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\nThe image above presents the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic with its phases. I applied this schematic to the Bitcoin daily chart, as you saw at the beginning of the article, and it seems we are in Phase B at ST.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong, and we may be in Phase C, but it is better to prepare for another bull trap at 40K and then a drop — bear trap — at 27k.\n\nI think Bitcoin will follow the arrows drawn in the chart. I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**. Thus, the bear market won’t come until 2022.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nNow, I cannot recommend and advise you into doing anything with your money because **I am not a financial advisor.** I can recommend **preparing for any scenario**. Nothing is certain, just probable.\n\nIf you want to educate yourself in the crypto market, I recommend reading [my article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fcrypto-research-tools-that-supercharged-my-investing-strategy) on this topic.

Not to mention the suicide rates.\n\nAlso, did you know that most **lottery winners end up broke**? That is the root cause of their misery.\n\nThe focus of this article is to make you change your perception of wealth. It is somehow counterintuitive to believe that making more money will make you wealthier.\n\n### Easy come, easy go\n\nIn S01:E14 of Two And A Half Men, Charlie goes broke. His accountant is trying to explain to him how this happened because Charlie was shocked. He gave a very intuitive explanation.\n\nHe made the analogy for cash flow by comparing it with water pouring inside a plastic cup with a hole at the bottom.\n\nWhen water comes inside the cup faster than it drains, the cup remains full for a while, even after the water stops flowing. Of course, this happens if the hole is only one and not too large.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, he had ten holes at the bottom of the cup, and as soon as water stopped coming, the cup stopped having water.\n\nThe analogy is simple: **if you spend more than you earn, you will always be poor.**\n\nIf you have zero or a negative balance in your wallet or bank account at the end of each month, then you are spending too much. You will not even realize this but will think you are not earning enough.\n\nSay you do find a solution to earn more money, and you succeed. Do you think it will fix the root cause of your case? In most cases, it will not because your mindset is the same.\n\n**The real issue you have a consumer mindset. When you have more, you think you afford more. As a result, you spend more.**\n\nIf you were to change your mindset from a consumer to an investor, you would realize you spend too much on liabilities and not on assets.\n\nAlso, you would see that more money equals more savings for possible investments and not more spending on things you do not need.\n\n### Exceptions to the rule\n\nI get it. You are already cutting your expenses at a minimum because you were not so fortunate. In your case, the solution is only to increase your income.\n\nThere is a catch to this exception, though. If you were to make more money, you would probably have the urge to compensate for all those years of lack of wealth.\n\nThe example above is what happened to me. I made more money than I ever needed, and still, I ended up borrowing money from others from time to time. Fortunately, I realized my issues and fixed them at the right moment.\n\n### Takeaways\n\nIf you are struggling with your money, look first at your expenses before trying to earn more.\n\n-   check your bills: are you wasting electricity, water, gas, etc.?\n-   check your transportation: can you walk or take the bus instead of the car?\n-   check your subscriptions: do you need Netflix, Spotify, YouTube Premium, Amazon Prime, etc.?\n-   check your shopping: do you need new clothes, new accessories, new devices, etc.?\n\nThe list continues but, in summary, adopt a minimalistic lifestyle. Think twice before clicking the buy button.\n\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.

So, what is this? Glad you asked. This is the Wyckoff Method. In Layman’s terms:\n\n\u003E The Wyckoff Method is a method of determining when a market is manipulated by big guys — “Composite man” — into their advantage.\n\nYou read right, manipulated. The method was developed for stocks, but it can be applied to any market, including our new crypto market.\n\nThe Wyckoff method describes two chart patterns of manipulation, which can predict long-term movement: **distribution and accumulation**.\n\nIn the distribution pattern, big guys (“Whales”, “the Composite man”, etc.) sell their shares and manipulate the market into a downtrend.\n\nIn the accumulation phase, big guys buy as many cheap shares as possible and then manipulate the market into an uptrend\n\nIn the crypto arena, Bitcoin is the market mover. Where Bitcoin goes, the market eventually flows. Thus, by looking at the Bitcoin 1D chart, we see almost perfectly a **Wyckoff distribution** chart pattern. More about the Wyckoff method [here](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![Wyckoff Distribution](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F800\u002F0*cf6ZyDFaCrld-Q8i.png)\n\nIf we look at the Bitcoin chart and the Wyckoff distribution schematic, they sure look pretty much the same.\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I sold everything with the intent to buy back at 30K or less. Of course, I may be wrong, nothing is certain. In this case, I will buy back in at 43k, after the 42k resistance is broken.\n\nNow, I won’t buy only Bitcoin. As I said, everything goes down sooner or later following Bitcoin, as we saw in May and along the years.\n\nThe last time I saw a [bearish indicator or pattern](https:\u002F\u002Frazvantomegea.medium.com\u002Fafter-the-crash-this-bitcoin-indicator-knew-it-all-along-439633cea698) and didn’t follow the plan, I lost half my money (all my profit). I won’t make that mistake again.\n\nIf I am wrong, then we are currently already in the Wyckoff accumulation phase and we will go to the moon (100k) sooner. I think we will go to 30K one last time and then go up.\n\n### Takeaway\n\nThe takeaway is to be prepared for the crypto market going down another 10–20%. What you do in this scenario is up to you. I am no financial adviser and cannot recommend you do anything.\n\nHowever, I am presenting what I am doing in this case. I sold everything and waiting to buy the dip (30k) or buying again when we have a stronger uptrend (42k+).\n\nFurthermore, you should always be prepared for a market crash by analyzing the greed and having an exit strategy.

These cryptos are sorted descending by market capitalization.\n\nMost people have  **turned the crypto market into gambling**  by choosing the newest crypto, with the lowest market cap, with the bet they will give them 100x profit. However, they can also go to 0 and lose everything.\n\nFew people have the  **patience  and knowledge to read and understand the whitepaper**  of low cap crypto and only those have the potential to make 100x gains. The rest of the people will lose money.\n\nLet’s be honest, crypto is new and, thus, very volatile. Even Bitcoin, the highest market cap crypto is volatile and can drop 50% in 1 month — as we saw in May. Also,  **Bitcoin is the lowest risk crypto and gives 10x returns in 4 years**, as history has shown.\n\n\u003E If Bitcoin can give 10x returns if buying the lowest and selling the highest within the 4-year cycle, why on earth would I look at low or medium market cap cryptos which have a high risk of going to hell?\n\nI chose to research and buy only in 5 cryptos, which belong to the top 25 on CoinMarketCap. The rationale is simple,  **there will always be top 25 cryptos, and there will always be top 5 from these top 25**.\n\nThis helps me sleep at night, not stress during market swings, and hold for the entire bull market. Of course,  **I am selling during a bear market**  because I want to buy in at low prices.\n\nI am a long-term trader for now with crypto and any other market. I may hold my buys for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, who knows; it all depends on how the market moves. You chose the strategy that makes you happy.\n\n# Bitcoin vs Altcoins\n\nThis is very interesting.  **Bitcoin has become the S&P 500 index of the crypto market.**  You see, we look at the price evolution of cryptos compared to the USD, which is not a good metric.\n\nWe should compare altcoins’ price evolution to Bitcoin’s to see if we are making a better portfolio performance compared to if we were holding Bitcoin alone. Most of the time,  **Bitcoin outperforms altcoins and crypto portfolios in the long term**.\n\nBefore learning about crypto, I bought mindlessly and I would have had a better portfolio performance if I would have just bought Bitcoin and Ethereum.  **There is beauty in simplicity.**\n\nAll of this being said, I only look at the top 25 for my crypto research, because I am sure I will outperform Bitcoin using this strategy. Also,  **the higher the market cap, the higher the liquidity, the more exchange listing, the more research resources, the greater the community.**\n\nThis simplicity applies to most investments. Always  **put in balance the risk\u002Freward ratio and the hustle and stress involved**  in researching. I want to keep things simple and as safe as possible and expect big returns in the long term.\n\nWhat is your strategy? Leave a comment.

You see, there are hundreds of fitness trackers and health trackers out there, but they are all separated.\n\nThink about it: you need a training app, diet tracking app, exercise tracking app, a sleep app, a biomarker tracking app, body composition app. So many apps to track your entire lifestyle.\n\nNot to mention you need to download them all, which will make your phone storage throw up.

It’s our genetics and we don’t need to blame ourselves for this, but we need to accept it and work on it.\r\n\r\nEveryone in my life is amazed at how much I eat and still stay fit. I can eat more than 1kg of food in one sitting and usually do it to feel full. It depends on how tired I am or how much exercise I do.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are the same; **you feel ashamed because you are hungry all the time or just like eating**. You are also ashamed because you are not in your best shape and try to hide it by eating a salad in front of people.\r\n\r\nI am glad you found this article because it will change your life. **Losing body fat is not a matter of eating less and exercising more** as pop culture promotes. And no, you don’t have to do those weird and complex exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when you are creating a healthy lifestyle, you **don’t overwhelm yourself with a lot of new routines**: regular sleep schedule, go to the gym, daily steps, water intake, diet plan, mindful eating, etc. It’s too much.\r\n\r\nStart with one thing at a time and gradually increase. The first step is your diet because **you can’t and will never overexercise a poor diet**, not with our foody genetics at least.\r\n\r\n### Low-calorie filling foods\r\n\r\nBehold the secret that changed the lives of foodies. **Losing fat is a matter of caloric deficit (on paper)**. However, just counting calories and being in an energy deficit is not enough and sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is **losing body fat in real work is a matter of hormones**. Hormones dictate how much we eat which then translates into how many calories we ingest.\r\n\r\nThe main hormones responsible for how much we eat are **ghrelin and leptin**. Of course, dopamine, CCK, cortisol, and adrenaline also have a role. All hormones have a role in eating as everything is interconnected.\r\n\r\nGhrelin dictates how hungry we are, and leptin dictates how full and satisfied we are. Obviously, **to lose body fat we need to feel full and satisfied most of the time with fewer calories**.\r\n\r\nThe only way is to eat **foods that are low in calories, high in volume, and taste good**. If the volume decreases or calories increase, that taste should also decrease because food that tastes too good (too palatable) dictates overeating (calories).\r\n\r\nFood must taste good though, otherwise, we are prone to binging or cheating with foods that are calories dense. I also found a way to create low calories duplicates of my favorite treats, like snickers bars or apple cake.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, **you need to cook and prepare your food.** I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it is hard to find low-calorie and high-volume foods in restaurants and grocery shops.\r\n\r\n**It’s like the world is focused on making you fat with the foods they’re selling.**\r\n\r\nIf you want some recipes and don’t know where to start, follow Scott Murray or Greg Doucette on YouTube. Only low-calorie and filling foods there.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
