For what is worth, I think most of them are bullshit.\n\nI am also talking about spot reduction. Does any of the ads: “10-minute Ab Workout To Melt Belly Fat” or “Best Exercises For Thin Legs” ring a bell? Trust me; spot reduction is a myth.\n\nThe body decides based on hormones and genetics where to store and from where to burn fat. It’s out of our control.\n\nThe only thing we can do is manage our calories and ensure we burn more than we consume — or consume less than we burn.\n\nWe will analyze the most popular exercise routines and see which burns the most calories (fat).\n\n# Strength training\n\nI am sorry to break your bubble, but strength training burns the least amount of calories. Strength training is not for burning fat necessarily, but for improving body composition by increasing contractile tissue.\n\nDepending on your body weight, age, and gender, you may burn around (+\u002F- 100kcal) 300 kcal per hour of strength training. We are excluding any form of cardio from this.\n\nAlso, during that hour of training, we are doing it intensely with a maximum of 1–2 minutes rest between sets and reps (on the timer).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*TcIKZFBwB-mQaJvpTGCZ4Q.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nStrength training is a high-intensity interval training regimen and cannot be maintained for long periods. It has a high impact on the nervous system, muscular system, and cardiovascular system.\n\nIf someone works out for more than one and a half hours, he’s either wasting time, either doing some cardio, either is on PEDs.\n\nAccording to our human physiology, this form of exercise relies on glycogen and blood glucose for energy. Body fat is almost untouched during the session.\n\nAlso, building more muscle will increase your resting metabolic rate, which means you will burn more calories doing nothing. It’s kind of an investment.\n\nCombine this knowledge with the fact that strength training burns few calories, for sure strength training is not for fat loss, but muscle building and general health and wellbeing.\n\n# Running\n\nRunning is medium to high intensity aerobic exercise, depending on the pace. This type of exercise burn the most amount of energy per hour, some of it (25%) coming from body fat during the session.\n\nIt is for this reasons why most people choose running for fat loss. Aerobic exercise relies mostly on body fat for energy and it also burns a lot of calories.\n\nRunning for one hour at 8 miles per hour (12 km\u002Fh) burns around 1000 kcal (+\u002F- 200 kcal). It is 3 times more than strength training. Even running for 30 minutes burns more than strength training.\n\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*EolPGk2S9_Zt1X_ah9kzqQ.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nHowever, running alone for long periods of times may also burn muscle mass as it is catabolic and doesn’t stimulate muscle growth. If you don’t believe me, look at all the runners (not sprinters) out there and decide for yourself.\n\nRunning is also taxing your cardiovascular and nervous system and cannot be performed daily. I found running fun from time to time, but cannot do it more than once or twice per week.\n\nIn conclusion, running burns the most amount of calories, improves the cardiovascular system, but cannot be done often.\n\n# Walking\n\nWalking is my favorite form of exercise. I wrote an article about walking [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4). I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.\n\nI like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.\n\nWalking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+\u002F- 100 kcal).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nIt is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.\n\nWith all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.\n\n-   strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;\n-   running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;\n-   walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.\n\nThe winner is walking because of the consistency. Slow, long-term consistent progress will always beat fat, short-term progress.\n\nHowever, walking does not improves any muscle, neither skeletal, nor cardiovascular. Make no mistake, strength training and running may not burn more calories, but they do offer more health and fitness benefits than walking.\n\nIn my opinion, all three forms of exercise must be incorporated and combined in ones lifestyle for health and fitness purposes.\n\nI do include them, however I must work on my running (medium intensity aerobic exercise) routine, as I skip it because it makes me very tired.\n\n**What are your favorite exercises?
