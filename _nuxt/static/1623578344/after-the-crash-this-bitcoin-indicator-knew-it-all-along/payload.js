We experienced a crypto market crash this week because of a chain of events, but could have we predict this? Seems yes.\r\n\r\nSome useful tools indicate when Bitcoin — and the entire crypto market — is oversold or overbought. I talked about this in another [article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fcrypto-research-tools-that-supercharged-my-investing-strategy).\r\n\r\nFrom all the tools, only one seems to have predicted Bitcoin being overbought since April 13th. It also predicted the same thing in 2013, around the same period (April 9th).\r\n\r\n### The Pi Cycle Indicator\r\n\r\n[The Pi Cycle indicator](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002Fcharts\u002Fpi-cycle-top-indicator\u002F) predicted crashes in 2013 both times, in 2017, and now in 2021. I saw it, but I was too cocky and foolish to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe good part is we are not in a bear market yet, we will experience a new boom until the end of this year. We will keep an eye on the indicator and see.\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
