I see so many people getting married and getting divorced in less than ten years. I also see men and women ran away like road runner when they hear of something serious.\r\n\r\nWe live in fucked up times, and our hormones are also fucked up. Maybe this is one of the big causes of a relationship crisis.\r\n\r\nBack in my high school years, I was a player. I liked hooking up with every girl I found attractive. It was a great feeling, but come on now... I was a kid.\r\n\r\nAfter my father met another woman and got married, I got into a depression. I lived alone for five years and lost my self-confidence. This had a big impact on my further social life, including sex life.\r\n\r\nA year ago, I started hanging out again and seeing new faces. My biggest problem was my self-confidence because I didn't believe in myself almost at all. I was looking for validation and became needy, and people feel these things.\r\n\r\nWe are all connected in ways we cannot understand. We are 99.99% energy, and we all vibrate at different frequencies and radiate various energy fields. We immediately feel when a person has high energy or low energy.\r\n\r\nA needy, insecure person like my past self repels people, especially women, from their lives. We usually repel what we need the most. In other words, we repel what we feel we lack or what we think we are not worthy of. That's why we need validation. We don't acknowledge our values.\r\n\r\nYou are awesome, remember that. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. You need to show it to yourself and repeat it every day. I challenge you do write down at least 10 of your best values and achievements.\r\n\r\nThe moment you begin to feel your awesomeness without the need to say it out loud, the world around you will change. Life will be beautiful.\r\n\r\nDon't chase people and things; make them chase you by believing you are worthy of anything. Trust yourself and the Universe. \r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
