Just because it is available on a DEX like Uniswap doesn’t mean you should swap your money for it.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, each stock has some fundamentals that can be analyzed and help you better understand if the stock (company) is worth investing in (e.g. financials, niche, CEO, vision, etc.).\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies also have  some fundamentals that can be analyzed. If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https:\u002F\u002Fcoinmarketcap.com\u002F). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.intotheblock.com\u002F)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cryptoratingcouncil.com\u002Fasset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Faltcoin-season-index\u002F)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.blockchaincenter.net\u002Fbitcoin-rainbow-chart\u002F). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com\u002F)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I choose crypto assets in the top 50 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n2.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n3.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n4.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n5.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n6.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n7.  I make sure the assets have high volume;\r\n8.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n10.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
