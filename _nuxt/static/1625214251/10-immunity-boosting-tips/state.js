This article and blog are purely educational and informational._\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live dark times, that's for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntil the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.\r\n\r\n# Fresh air\r\n\r\nWe need fresh air to purify ourselves. **We live most of our lives in boxes**: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe some of you don't have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, **open the damn windows** and let the air come in. Don't incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStaying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day**. If I don't, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.\r\n\r\n# Vitamin D3\r\n\r\nAnother reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don't get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVitamin d3 is **essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin** (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don't agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check [Dr. Mercola's website](https:\u002F\u002Fvitamind.mercola.com\u002F).\r\n\r\n# (Less) Hygiene\r\n\r\nDisinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That's what they keep on saying everywhere we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHippocrates said: \"Everything in excess is opposed to nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is also a saying: \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExcess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they **disrupt our microbiome.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria** within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, **antibacterial does not mean antiviral**, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, our **microbiome is essential in developing antibodies**. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is enough to **use regular soap** to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check [this](https:\u002F\u002Fen.unesco.org\u002Fnews\u002Fhow-soap-kills-covid-19-hands) and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.uchealth.org\u002Ftoday\u002Fwhy-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus\u002F)). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYour body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you're tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.\r\n\r\n# Healthy food\r\n\r\nWe are what we eat, that's for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won't grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you make your diet based on **vegetables and fruits**. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you're not vegan or vegetarian, **lean meats** are great. If you tolerate **eggs and fish,** Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nSleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExercise **increases blood flow and oxygenation**, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.\r\n\r\n# Stress management\r\n\r\n(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because **chronic stress lowers our immune system**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFind ways to relax as much as you can. For me, **exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep** do miracles.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nForce yourself to **smile and be optimistic**. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n# Cold showers\r\n\r\nI have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. **I feel warm all the time** because my circulation is improved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. **Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.\r\n\r\n# Medicinal mushrooms\r\n\r\nNo, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest **medicinal mushrooms may** [**improve immunity**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002F31520706\u002F)**, may have** [**antioxidant properties**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubag.nal.usda.gov\u002Fcatalog\u002F6995766) **and may** [**fight cancer**](https:\u002F\u002Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u002F32504783\u002F)**.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe most popular medicinal mushroom is **Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)**. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.\r\n\r\n# Turmeric and Ginger\r\n\r\nTurmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nccih.nih.gov\u002Fhealth\u002Fginger), and [this](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nccih.nih.gov\u002Fhealth\u002Fturmeric)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGinger and turmeric may have **anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**, which in turn boost the immune system. Again, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any herb and supplement.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
