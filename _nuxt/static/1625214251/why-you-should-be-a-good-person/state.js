The primary reason is that people have become too self-centered and mean to each other. Few people do something for others out of self-interest.\r\n\r\nThere are good people out there, but they are lost in the crowd. They concluded that it is a waste of time to be the right person in a world of selfishness, meanness, crime, robbery, etc. Is it now?\r\n\r\n# The Hard And Right Way\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that evil is the easy road. As you can see, anybody can do it. Being kind, on the other hand, is the hard path and the right path as well. Being kind, you emit love while consuming hate and pain. Being unkind, you emit hate and pain while consuming love from other people.\r\n\r\nWe need to be the change we want to see in the world. If we want the world to be a better place, we need to be better.\r\n\r\n# Karma and Reincarnation\r\n\r\nI believe in karma and the afterlife. You see, have you ever wondered why children are born with diseases or in poverty or without parents? I don't believe in bad luck or chance. The Universe has a purpose and a way of ordering things that we don't understand.\r\n\r\nYou see, the entire Universe is made of energy, including us; that's a fact. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. When we die, our energy is reused in the Universe for further forms of life or matter. The process of energy reuse is what reincarnation is all about.\r\n\r\nThere is also the idea that we go to heaven or hell, depending on the kind of people we were. I believe heaven and hell are just oxymorons for further lives. What do I mean by this? You see, we gain and put energy into the Universe through our words, actions, thoughts, and emotions. All that energy will turnaround in the next life.\r\n\r\nEverything we think, feel, and do is invested in the Universe. The Universe learns and evolves based on every individual's actions. It is like a machine learning algorithm. Every next epoch (life) is based on the previous epoch in order to learn what it is meant to learn.\r\n\r\n# The Bigger Picture\r\n\r\nBeing the right person is an investment; you struggle now, but will be happy and fulfilled later. Being the wrong person is exactly the opposite.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am hallucinating, or it is too Sci-Fy what I just discussed here, but for me, these ideas make me see the bigger picture. These ideas help me combine science and religion as they both indicate the same direction, but with different paths (words).\r\n\r\nI believe our sensory systems and perceptions are inputs through which the Universe (God) sees itself. The Universe learns through you and changes based on your thoughts and emotions - as within, so without.\r\n\r\nEvery living organism is a manifestation of the Universe, through which the Universe perceives itself from different points of view. We are all connected to the same source of consciousness. We are one.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is: **think, feel, and act like someone is always watching you because it is - you are - and treat every living organism like you would treat yourself because it is - we are one source of consciousness.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003E If you found this article useful give it an Upvote, Recommend, and share it to help other people become smarter for free as you did.
