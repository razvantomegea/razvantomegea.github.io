It may sound like a fairytale, but it is possible in the world of investing. I entered this world three years ago, and I lost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore we begin with my investing mistakes, let's understand what investing is. In the simplest terms, investing is saving money and making them work for you. The money you invest is called capital.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can read more about investing basics on [Investopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.investopedia.com\u002Farticles\u002Fbasics\u002F06\u002Finvest1000.asp) as it exceeds the scope of this article. I also recommend reading \"The Richest Man In Babylon,\" \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\" and \"The Intelligent Investor.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my investing journey, I made the mistakes the books above tell not to do. Hence, I lost about $5000. It may sound a little to some people, but for me, it is a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI learned after so money years that I wasn't investing but gambling because I didn't know what I was doing, which brings me to my worst mistake.\r\n\r\n# Not Knowing What You're Investing In\r\n\r\nIf you're buying stocks, commodities, forex, crypto, or any other market just by analyzing a chart or by following the herd, you're not investing but gambling. You're better off betting in sports or playing in a casino.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy biggest mistake was not reading and informing myself enough. The biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffet, reads 8 hours per day about finance and the economy. When he invests, he knows for sure his investment will grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're investing, for example, in Amazon stock, don't just blindly invest because you herd Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet (or was before he divorced) or because it is in the top 10 companies in the world. It is not necessarily a good investment now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRead, read, read, and read again.\r\n\r\n# I Want Profit Now\r\n\r\nAnother mistake I made was wanting to make a lot of profit as soon as possible. It is truly a fairytale and a one in a million situations unless you have such a large capital that you invest in crypto at the right moment and a big spike happens like in 2017.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recently realized that investing is making a reasonable profit in more than five years. It applies to start-ups too; don't expect a large income in months, only in years or even decades.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want more money now, ask for a raise or get a better job.\r\n\r\n# Getting Emotional On Volatility\r\n\r\nI don't know if you've ever seen a market trend, but it is not smoothly going up or down. Trends have ups and downs that it is why trend moving averages are useful to determine the long term trend.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI made the mistake of exiting a bullish (up) long term trend because it became bearish (down) for the short term. It is ok to change directions from time to time. The intelligent investor buys when down trends happen after reversals because the market riched a new low.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nInvesting is buying a book worth $10 for $9 or less. If you see something of high value that a low price at the moment, then it is an opportunity to invest and wait. Always look at the big picture and don't be moved by periods of volatility.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, stay informed, as we can't guarantee that the change in direction is not the next long-term direction. For instance, Warren Buffet sold bank and airline stocks due to the pandemic which cause a global lockdown and economic crisis.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you think the trend is at its highest, sell if the market is about to reverse and enter again only if the market rebounds.\r\n\r\n# Ignoring The Leverage\r\n\r\nLeverage is a tool the allows an investor to multiply his investment by a given ratio. I lost the most amount of money because of this.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf the trend goes in your favor, you will make a lot of money in a short amount of time. However, you can also lose a lot of money in a snap; it happened to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI gambled on products with leverage that went well for a while, then reversed, and it cost me dearly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNever use leverage tool, or invest small amounts. You can win a lot but can lose a lot. It is better to go on a low-risk small win than a high-risk big win (from my experience).\r\n\r\n# Not Diversifying\r\n\r\nI used to invest in a single market a large amount of my capital: big mistake.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlways look for multiple opportunities or invest small fractions of your capital. The logic is simple: if one market goes down, there is a weak chance the others also go down, unless they are related.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDiversification means investing in different areas, not just in different markets or companies. For instance, investing in 10 airline companies is not necessarily a diversification.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like to invest in tech companies because I am a tech guy and because I believe they frame the future. You should do your research and invest in something that represents you and in which you have faith.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};d[1]={id:"how-to-make-money-blogging",author:e,title:"How To Make Money From Blogging?",createdOn:"Sep 28, 2020",categories:a,description:"I guess you have probably been wondering how people who write articles on the web or make videos on YouTube make money from their creations.

Maybe you have a passion for this and want to know if you can create a business by doing what you love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are multiple possibilities to make money from this, but the easiest and most common way is through Google Adsense.\r\n\r\n# Google Adsense\r\n\r\nGoogle Adsense is an advertising service provided by Google that gives you the possibility to show ads on your creations. For instance, you probably saw that I have ads on my blog. I created a Google Adsense account and connected my blog to it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn YouTube, you have to go to your channel setting and click Monetize. It will allow Youtube to show ads on your videos if the videos have a duration of at least 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n# Sponsors\r\n\r\nMany bloggers partner with sponsors and promote their products. You may have heard on YouTube bloggers saying: \"Today's video is sponsored by ...\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBeing sponsored is not that easy. You first need a targeted audience and minimum daily traffic. It makes sense because if I were a big company that wanted to promote my products, I would have chosen a blog with high traffic to ensure the biggest audience.\r\n\r\n# Donations\r\n\r\nSome bloggers don't like showing ads on their content because of some beliefs that ads Google and Facebook algorithms manipulate people, which is true. Thus, they choose to allow viewers to donate at their will.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nServices like Patreon and Ko-fi offer this possibility. I also have accounts there, and people can contribute.\r\n\r\n# What to expect?\r\n\r\nIf you are new to blogging or have a new channel or website, don't expect income soon. Your focus should be quality content and driving traffic. It means that if you're doing it for money, don't even think about it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started blogging as a self-therapy and still doing it because I want to inform people. I want to share unbiased information and eliminate the confusion, the same way Brian Rose did with London Real.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStart blogging if you have a big passion for it only, and you would do it for free. The money will come in time if you are consistent. It is a lesson for any business, not just blogging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};d[2]={id:"do-you-need-college",author:f,title:"Do You Need To Go To College?

My grandmother keeps saying that because she has a small pension. Unfortunately for her and other people in my country, their pensions stay the same, but the costs increase year after year.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs a comparison, people with Ph.Ds and degrees in some domains have big pensions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, is a degree the absolute requirement for a good life? The answer is: it **depends on your personality and goals**. How come?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn my country, there are a lot of people with only maybe eight classes and have expensive cars and huge houses. They didn't even go to high school but have more money than a Ph.D.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI also learned from \"[Rich Dad](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCuifm5ns5SRG8LZJ6gCfKyw)\" that you don't need to go to school to make money because they don't teach money in school.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to make money, you don't need a college necessarily, but there is a catch: you need to be **self-disciplined and a risk-taker**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's be honest: it is much easier and safer to work as an employee; you have a stable and guaranteed monthly payment. Keep in mind, though, that **working as an employee is not that guaranteed** as you think. I know people who were very dedicated and respected at their workplace, and still lost their jobs because the company needed to cut back on expenses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is what happened this year because of the pandemic. Millions of people lost their jobs, not because they did something wrong, but because business began to fail. I lost colleagues because the company lost a client and had to cut down expenses, and I fear that it cand happen to me someday.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live in days in which it is more important how you look than who you are or what you do. Hence, **you need a college if you want to be an employee** because the certificate is required.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a degree in computer science, but I don't consider myself a computer engineer because I know almost nothing about electronics and physics. I never liked them because I didn't have good teachers in school (that's my excuse, at least). I consider myself a software engineer, though.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I learned to code mostly at home, watching youtube videos**, and writing a lot of small apps. I have a passion for web development, which, funny enough, college didn't teach me anything about it. I am self-taught. Now, I work as a web developer, and people keep recruiting me on LinkedIn for web development positions. It wouldn't have happened if I didn't have had a computer science diploma.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn LinkedIn, **recruiters don't look at you**, or you don't even appear in search results **if you don't have a degree and certificate** in something. It doesn't matter if you master any domain; **you need a certificate for the employers to pay you properly** and to maintain your position. It is how the system works.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only case where knowledge without proof on paper makes sense is when you create your own business, and you are your boss. If you **have a business idea, you are a hard-worker, you are disciplined, and are willing to risk, then college is just an obstacle in your way** and a waste of time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is better, though, to have a plan B. In case your business fails, what will you do? Also, **starting a business requires capital, and it takes years until you make some money** out of it. Where will you get the money until then? If you have some wealthy parents, good for you. Few are that lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCollege is useful as a starting point and backup for whatever happens, but don't put your faith in it too much. You will still have to research and learn on your own in college as well because no one will push you as teachers did in school.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI had my first job as a grocery shop seller during the summer. Afterward, I worked as a waiter, then in a tv show audience, then as a factory worker, then, for the first time, as a software quality tester. The latter was my first job in my software development career. Now, I am a free-lancer in software development and trying to develop some business of my own, including to invest.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started at the Employee cashflow quadrant, moved to the Self-employed quadrant, and now moving slowly to the Investor quadrant, and maybe even to the Big Business. \"The Cashflow Quadrant\" is another book by Robert Kiyosaki that I read and recommend it.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   college is required if you want to be a well-paid employee (stability and some guarantee);\r\n-   we don't learn money in school, so we don't need school to make money;\r\n-   starting a business requires a good idea, self-discipline, hard work, capital, patience, and guts (know your personality type);\r\n-   the best option is to have a plan B; begin as an employee and move gradually towards the forth cashflow quadrant, the big business.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Do This!",createdOn:"Sep 14, 2020",categories:a,description:"Who doesn't want more money?

You may think that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates have enough money, but they don't. These guys are at another level. They no longer see money as we do - spending potential. They see money as capital for investments. It is how they made their fortune.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there you have it. If you want to increase your wealth, start investing. Easy, right? Surely not. Investing requires some **financial education, some capital, and lots of patience**. A lot of us don't have these qualities, but we can earn them.\r\n\r\n# Financial education\r\n\r\nFinancial education teaches us about money and how to earn it smartly. I recommend reading **\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\"** written by Robert Kiyosaki and **\"The Richest Man In Babylon,\"** written by George Clason**.** The biggest lesson I learned from these books is the value of making money work for you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, we are taught in school to work for money, but these books teach us to make money work for us. It is how top Forbes successful people did it and continue to do it. It is straightforward for them, but not for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou must be asking now: how can I make money work for me if I don't have any? Shouldn't I work for money first to earn them? It depends on your character. Many **successful investors invest money which isn't theirs**. You can do it too if you have the guts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor example, you can borrow money, invest, make some profit, payback, and reinvest your profit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOthers start their own business and then invest, but this is still the same concept: **make money work for you.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is to educate yourself on finances. Learn everything you can about how money works. You can start with the two books mentioned above and with \"The Rich Dad Channel\" on Youtube.\r\n\r\n# Personal finance management\r\n\r\nIt is the point of this article and the first step in making money: cash-flow. Where does your money go? Do you buy more liabilities (cars, clothes, parties) than assets (real estate, commodities, businesses)? Do you save money every month, or do you spend mindlessly?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTaking **control of your finances is the first step in making money** work for you. If every month you remain with 0 and you depend on the next salary, then you are not doing something right. You are consuming too much. I advise you to lower your consumption or increase your income so that every month you **save at least 10% of your income.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSaving 10% every month is not that big a deal, but makes a big difference in the long run as you increase your capital. Having capital is the initial step in investing and making money work for you.\r\n\r\n# **Investments**\r\n\r\nNow that you have a capital, you must make it work for you. If you keep on **saving money without investing, it will depreciate** as inflation increases every year. This year will be the worst in the last two centuries as the pandemic affects the global economy, especially the US economy and dollar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn important question is where to invest?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started taking a look at the stock market, commodities, and ETFs. I lost a pretty lot of money before I educated myself enough. I advise you to be prudent and learn from my mistakes. **Don't invest in something you don't understand**. You can also make a bank savings deposit that pays annual interest rates.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDo your research and choose something with minimum risk and in which you feel confident.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   save 10% of your income every month;\r\n-   start reading financial education books;\r\n-   invest smartly.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!
