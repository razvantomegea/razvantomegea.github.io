Maybe there are some professional recommendations out there that make sense, but on the news, I heard and seen only this:\n\n-   sanitize everything you can;\n-   avoid people;\n-   stay incubated.\n\nAll recommendations focus on the external, not the internal, especially on sanitization. I am not saying we should not be clean; on the contrary. I am a big fan of washing my hands and no putting my hands in my mouth.\n\nHowever, I am not a fan of over-cleaning. Overdoing or underdoing anything is not good. Excess hygiene destroys our microbiome (trillions of bacteria on the body), which are involved in our immunity — among other things (“The Hygiene Hypothesis”).\n\n### What about our immune system?\n\nThe main idea is it is uncertainty about “you know what.” We know almost nothing about it or (they) hide what we know to create mass manipulation. I don’t know and don’t want to be a part of conspiracy theories without facts.\n\nWhat I do know is our first and primary defense system against any pathogen is our immune system. No one can contradict me on this one.\n\nThink of vaccines, for instance. What do they do? They train the immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pathogen. It’s still the immune system that does the job.\n\nAntibiotics and other pharmaceuticals either destroy all life within us (“anti” — against, “bios” — life) either help the immune system.\n\nSo, isn’t it common sense to receive information on how to make our immune system stronger? Just think about it. I am so frustrated because there are no recommendations on how to improve our immune system.\n\nMaybe because they couldn’t make money out of this? Or because they don’t care about us (MJ knew it)? Or maybe, because a strong immune system is enough?\n\nYou do the judgment call. What I am saying is regardless of what happens, you should focus on improving the immune system. It is our only defense against pathogens, tumors, and the majority of illnesses.\n\n### My habits for a strong immunity\n\n-   relaxing and stress management;\n-   good quality sleep (11:00 p.m. — 07:00 a.m.);\n-   exercise;\n-   vitamin D supplement;\n-   fish oil supplement;\n-   lots of vegetables;\n-   lean animal products for protein;\n-   lots of water;\n-   I limit chemicals on my body and using organic washing products.\n\nI found that chronic or excessive stress has the highest negative impact on my immune system. Whenever I have a lot of (psychological, emotional, or physical) stress, I “catch” a cold or some illness. It also happens when I don’t sleep well.\n\nIt is why stress management and sleep are the most important for my immune system. If I can’t do something good, at least I make sure I don’t do something bad.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.
