It seems I was right. Bitcoin went down to 29K, and the crypto market followed.\n\nOf course, I bought Bitcoin at 29K and afterward at 34K, as you see in the chart. I also bought ETH at 1.9K.\n\n# The Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nBuying Bitcoin at 34K was a mistake because I thought, at first, that we are in **Phase C of the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic**. However, a more careful chart analysis revealed that we are most probably — not for sure — in **Phase B**.\n\nIn my previous article, I said that we are about to end the **Wyckoff Distribution Schematic,** and it seems we did, probably sooner than I saw. We can easily see that the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic has begun, and we are in the middle of it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the **Wyckoff Method,** read my [previous article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fhow-to-prepare-for-the-next-bitcoin-correction-with-the-wyckoff-method) or go directly to the [source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*C4HuCEj_xSB-bpas8-ytjw.png)\n\n[Source](https:\u002F\u002Fschool.stockcharts.com\u002Fdoku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\nThe image above presents the Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic with its phases. I applied this schematic to the Bitcoin daily chart, as you saw at the beginning of the article, and it seems we are in Phase B at ST.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong, and we may be in Phase C, but it is better to prepare for another bull trap at 40K and then a drop — bear trap — at 27k.\n\nI think Bitcoin will follow the arrows drawn in the chart. I will probably sell again at the next 40K and wait for Bitcoin to either break the 43K, either to go down back at 30K.\n\nI am almost sure that **Bitcoin — and the market — will go to 100K by the end of this year**. Thus, the bear market won’t come until 2022.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nNow, I cannot recommend and advise you into doing anything with your money because **I am not a financial advisor.** I can recommend **preparing for any scenario**. Nothing is certain, just probable.\n\nIf you want to educate yourself in the crypto market, I recommend reading [my article](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lifestylemaniacs.com\u002Fcrypto-research-tools-that-supercharged-my-investing-strategy) on this topic. You will find there some **useful research tools** that helped me a lot.\n\n----------\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.
