If a person owns a good-looking car or a specific brand, then that person is somebody important.\n\nHowever, many people don’t have enough money to from month to month, but they have an expensive car. It happens just so other people can validate them and increase their self-esteem.\n\nYes, people who show off with what they own are people with low self-esteem. So, before buying fancy cars, clothes, and jewelry to impress people, better focus on the root cause of this desire.\n\nA car is a tool to take you from point A to point B with a grade of comfort. Most cars cant take us here and there, but the comfort, looks, branding, and quality are different. For these four attributes, we pay the price.\n\nOf course, we all want a car that gives us a bit of comfort, especially if we travel by car a lot, and we want the car to be reliable. However, no matter the reliability, we will still need to invest in it like in a child.\n\nMake no mistake; a car is not an investment (asset) but a liability. For this reason, we need to choose it based on our income. Regardless we pick a fancy car if we don’t have the money to buy gas (or electricity) and maintain it.\n\nThe rule of thumb is to buy a car worth your four-month income. If your monthly income is $2000, you can afford an $8000 car. If your monthly income is $1000, you can afford a $4000 car.\n\nIt may sound too little, but it is the reality. Instead of wasting more money on a car, you would better focus on increasing your wealth by investing in assets: stocks, real estate, crypto, commodities.\n\nOr you can invest in yourself, develop new skills and get a better-paying job. The idea is to invest your money, not waste it on fancy stuff to fit in a fake society.\n"};g[1]={id:"stop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack",author:a,title:"Stop Doing This If You Want A Six-Pack",createdOn:"Aug 28, 2021",categories:e,description:"Myth debunking.",imageCredit:"Photo by Jannes Jacobs on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FpMQgDg_8z88",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fstop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack.md"},markdown:"Everybody likes having a good-looking beach body, and this implies having a visible six-pack. The six-pack has become the proof of fitness. A person is not considered to be fit, especially men if they don’t have a six-pack.\n\nIt is kind of sad because people may not have the genetics for a six-pack. Look at “The Rock”; he is big and muscular but without a visible six-pack. Isn’t he fit? Of course, he is.\n\nAlso, for women is harder than for men to have a visible six-pack because of hormones. However, having a slim waist is an indicator of fitness for both men and women.\n\nFor this reason, no amount of crunches or leg raises will make your abdominal muscles visible if your body fat is too high or if you don’t have the genetics for a visible six-pack.\n\nStop looking at those freaks online with popped-up abs like corn. Those people are not natural and maybe not even healthy. Yes, in some cases having such shredded abs is not healthy, especially for women.\n\nAsk any woman with a shredded si-pack if her menstrual cycle and libido are in the correct parameters. I guarantee you they are not.\n\nI am lucky enough to have the visible six-pack genetics. For starters, I store most of my fat on my hips, and second, I have popped up abs without doing crunches.\n\nI only do leg raises with the main goal of making my core stronger. I know that I am better off walking for 10 minutes than doing core exercises to make my abs visible.\n\nAb workouts also don’t burn body fat around your abs. Spot reduction is a myth. The body (hormones and genetics) decides where to burn body fat.\n\nIf you want just to have a visible six-pack or just a slim waist, stop doing ab workouts and start burning more calories to lose the body fat around your waist."};g[2]={id:"my-5-simple-tricks-to-increase-your-self-confidence-to-the-roof",author:a,title:"My 5 Simple Tricks To Increase Your Self-Confidence To The Roof",createdOn:"Aug 20, 2021",categories:f,description:"Be your own superhero.",imageCredit:"Photo by King Lip on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FS9uB_IlDThw",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fmy-5-simple-tricks-to-increase-your-self-confidence-to-the-roof.md"},markdown:"There is no arguing that confidence is an important skill no so many people have. Heck, even I am still struggling with confidence from time to time. However, I found some tricks that work for me during dark times.\n\nHere’s the deal; our inner state fluctuates. We cannot be constantly happy and smiling. There are times when we are sad, angry, depressed, and it’s ok. We need to accept and understand this is temporary.\n\nWhen it comes to confidence, it is something built during childhood. If your parents and family were supportive, then you probably have confidence.\n\nIf your family was not there for you when you needed them the most, or you have some childhood traumas, as I do, then you probably have some struggles with confidence.\n\nNo worries, though. You are not doomed. You can start building your confidence if you accept you have some issues with this part. We all have issues in some areas because we are imperfect humans in constant need of improvement.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that every person has different focus points that make her confident.\n\nFor instance, some people are confident if they have money or a good-looking car, whereas others are confident if they have good-looking bodies or clothes.\n\nThe truth is, all of these external helpers for confidence are something that the inner child always craved.\n\nIn my case, self-confidence comes from being fit, wealthy, and having loving people around me. It is because I lacked these things during my childhood.\n\nHowever, self-confidence should be independent of external factors and only dependent on faith and love from within.\n\nThus, let’s see what you can do to increase your self-confidence.\n\n# 1. Take care of your body\n\nEvery person who eats, exercises, and sleeps well is feeling great. There is also an old saying: “Mens sana in corpore sano,” which translates to “A healthy mind in a healthy body.”\n\nYour mind cannot be well if your body is not well. If your mind is not well, your life cannot be well. Everything begins from the mind.\n\nThe first step to increase your self-confidence is to take care of your body. Eat healthy food, exercise regularly, set a sleep schedule, and become healthy and fit.\n\n# 2. Set and complete realistic goals\n\nIn other words, get things done. If you are procrastinating and doing nothing, your subconscious will think of you as a loser. There is nothing worse when you sabotage yourself.\n\nI also found that a life without goals is meaningless. Learn something new, develop some hobbies, start some projects. You will increase your self-confidence for sure because you know within you are successful.\n\n# 3. Improve your posture\n\nIt is silly, but it works. It makes sense if you think about it. When you stay straight, you send signals to your brain that you are open and ready to face the world. More about this  [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2009\u002F10\u002F091005111627.htm).\n\nWhen you are sad, depressed, or scared, your body’s response is to slouch and be small. It turns out that vice versa is also true. When you slouch and get small, you tend to be depressed and sad.\n\nOur body and mind are linked bidirectionally. It is the same when you force yourself to smile when you are sad. You cannot smile and be sad at the same time.\n\n# 4. Meditate\n\nThere is a lot of research on meditation and its benefits. Meditation’s primary purpose is to train your mind and be present. You are also facing your thoughts, emotions, and inner world.\n\nThrough meditation, you will develop the discipline to control yourself and to no longer be in reaction. You will become more confident, calmer, and happier. You will also be able to sleep better and focus better.\n\n# 5. Love and accept yourself\n\nJesus said: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” It means you should love yourself first. If you don’t love yourself, how dare you expect others to love you?\n\nYou are the one who spends the most time with yourself, so you better learn to know, accept, and love who you are. There is and always will be one of you in this life.\n\nDon’t be too rough on yourself and accept you made and will make mistakes. We all do.\n\nWhen you begin to love yourself, you will love the world, and what others say and do won’t affect you anymore. You will have faith and confidence in yourself."};g[3]={id:"what-i-hate-about-the-health-recommendations-for-you-know-what",author:a,title:"What I Hate About The Health Recommendations For \"You Know What\"",createdOn:"Aug 16, 2021",categories:d,description:"Sanitize the world.",imageCredit:"Photo by Online Marketing on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FhIgeoQjS_iE",_meta:{resourcePath:"\u002FUsers\u002Frazvantomegea\u002FProjects\u002Flifestylemaniacs\u002Fcontents\u002Fwhat-i-hate-about-the-health-recommendations-for-you-know-what.md"},markdown:"Ever since this pandemic has begun, we have been bombarded with disinformation and professional health recommendations.\n\nI don’t know if you noticed, but all recommendations have been focusing on hygiene. Maybe there are some professional recommendations out there that make sense, but on the news, I heard and seen only this:\n\n-   sanitize everything you can;\n-   avoid people;\n-   stay incubated.\n\nAll recommendations focus on the external, not the internal, especially on sanitization. I am not saying we should not be clean; on the contrary. I am a big fan of washing my hands and no putting my hands in my mouth.\n\nHowever, I am not a fan of over-cleaning. Overdoing or underdoing anything is not good. Excess hygiene destroys our microbiome (trillions of bacteria on the body), which are involved in our immunity — among other things (“The Hygiene Hypothesis”).\n\n### What about our immune system?\n\nThe main idea is it is uncertainty about “you know what.” We know almost nothing about it or (they) hide what we know to create mass manipulation. I don’t know and don’t want to be a part of conspiracy theories without facts.\n\nWhat I do know is our first and primary defense system against any pathogen is our immune system. No one can contradict me on this one.\n\nThink of vaccines, for instance. What do they do? They train the immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pathogen. It’s still the immune system that does the job.\n\nAntibiotics and other pharmaceuticals either destroy all life within us (“anti” — against, “bios” — life) either help the immune system.\n\nSo, isn’t it common sense to receive information on how to make our immune system stronger? Just think about it. I am so frustrated because there are no recommendations on how to improve our immune system.\n\nMaybe because they couldn’t make money out of this? Or because they don’t care about us (MJ knew it)? Or maybe, because a strong immune system is enough?\n\nYou do the judgment call. What I am saying is regardless of what happens, you should focus on improving the immune system. It is our only defense against pathogens, tumors, and the majority of illnesses.\n\n### My habits for a strong immunity\n\n-   relaxing and stress management;\n-   good quality sleep (11:00 p.m. — 07:00 a.m.);\n-   exercise;\n-   vitamin D supplement;\n-   fish oil supplement;\n-   lots of vegetables;\n-   lean animal products for protein;\n-   lots of water;\n-   I limit chemicals on my body and using organic washing products.\n\nI found that chronic or excessive stress has the highest negative impact on my immune system. Whenever I have a lot of (psychological, emotional, or physical) stress, I “catch” a cold or some illness. It also happens when I don’t sleep well.\n\nIt is why stress management and sleep are the most important for my immune system. If I can’t do something good, at least I make sure I don’t do something bad.\n\n\n\u003E Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional.

For what is worth, I think most of them are bullshit.\n\nI am also talking about spot reduction. Does any of the ads: “10-minute Ab Workout To Melt Belly Fat” or “Best Exercises For Thin Legs” ring a bell? Trust me; spot reduction is a myth.\n\nThe body decides based on hormones and genetics where to store and from where to burn fat. It’s out of our control.\n\nThe only thing we can do is manage our calories and ensure we burn more than we consume — or consume less than we burn.\n\nWe will analyze the most popular exercise routines and see which burns the most calories (fat).\n\n# Strength training\n\nI am sorry to break your bubble, but strength training burns the least amount of calories. Strength training is not for burning fat necessarily, but for improving body composition by increasing contractile tissue.\n\nDepending on your body weight, age, and gender, you may burn around (+\u002F- 100kcal) 300 kcal per hour of strength training. We are excluding any form of cardio from this.\n\nAlso, during that hour of training, we are doing it intensely with a maximum of 1–2 minutes rest between sets and reps (on the timer).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*TcIKZFBwB-mQaJvpTGCZ4Q.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nStrength training is a high-intensity interval training regimen and cannot be maintained for long periods. It has a high impact on the nervous system, muscular system, and cardiovascular system.\n\nIf someone works out for more than one and a half hours, he’s either wasting time, either doing some cardio, either is on PEDs.\n\nAccording to our human physiology, this form of exercise relies on glycogen and blood glucose for energy. Body fat is almost untouched during the session.\n\nAlso, building more muscle will increase your resting metabolic rate, which means you will burn more calories doing nothing. It’s kind of an investment.\n\nCombine this knowledge with the fact that strength training burns few calories, for sure strength training is not for fat loss, but muscle building and general health and wellbeing.\n\n# Running\n\nRunning is medium to high intensity aerobic exercise, depending on the pace. This type of exercise burn the most amount of energy per hour, some of it (25%) coming from body fat during the session.\n\nIt is for this reasons why most people choose running for fat loss. Aerobic exercise relies mostly on body fat for energy and it also burns a lot of calories.\n\nRunning for one hour at 8 miles per hour (12 km\u002Fh) burns around 1000 kcal (+\u002F- 200 kcal). It is 3 times more than strength training. Even running for 30 minutes burns more than strength training.\n\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*EolPGk2S9_Zt1X_ah9kzqQ.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nHowever, running alone for long periods of times may also burn muscle mass as it is catabolic and doesn’t stimulate muscle growth. If you don’t believe me, look at all the runners (not sprinters) out there and decide for yourself.\n\nRunning is also taxing your cardiovascular and nervous system and cannot be performed daily. I found running fun from time to time, but cannot do it more than once or twice per week.\n\nIn conclusion, running burns the most amount of calories, improves the cardiovascular system, but cannot be done often.\n\n# Walking\n\nWalking is my favorite form of exercise. I wrote an article about walking [here](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fin-fitness-and-in-health\u002Fwhy-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4). I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.\n\nI like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.\n\nWalking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+\u002F- 100 kcal).\n\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1600\u002F1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking](https:\u002F\u002Fbodily.app\u002F)\n\nIt is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.\n\nWith all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.\n\n-   strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;\n-   running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;\n-   walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.\n\nThe winner is walking because of the consistency. Slow, long-term consistent progress will always beat fat, short-term progress.\n\nHowever, walking does not improves any muscle, neither skeletal, nor cardiovascular. Make no mistake, strength training and running may not burn more calories, but they do offer more health and fitness benefits than walking.\n\nIn my opinion, all three forms of exercise must be incorporated and combined in ones lifestyle for health and fitness purposes.\n\nI do include them, however I must work on my running (medium intensity aerobic exercise) routine, as I skip it because it makes me very tired.\n\n**What are your favorite exercises?

It turned out we only need one. Not only that, but this indicator provides a higher profit with a lower risk. Sounds too good to be true?\n\n# 50-day EMA\n\nFirst of all, we need to set up the chart style. We will only use the  **weekly and daily Heikin Ashi chart**. We will never look at charts below one day because it is too much noise.\n\nWe always look  in the long run, and we need to be patient and live our lives. The 50-day EMA on the weekly chart is a good long-term trend indicator.\n\n-   green Heikin Ashi candle above EMA (on both daily and weekly chart), we buy;\n-   we exit when a strong (no up shadows) red Heikin Ashi candle occurs on the weekly chart;\n-   red Heikin Ashi candle below EMA (on both daily and weekly chart), we sell;\n-   we exit when a strong (no down shadows) green Heikin Ashi candle occurs on the weekly chart.\n\nThat’s all. That is my strategy, backtested with many markets and assets, and the winning trades are at least three times greater than the losing trades.
