The six-pack has become the proof of fitness. A person is not considered to be fit, especially men if they don’t have a six-pack.\n\nIt is kind of sad because people may not have the genetics for a six-pack. Look at “The Rock”; he is big and muscular but without a visible six-pack. Isn’t he fit? Of course, he is.\n\nAlso, for women is harder than for men to have a visible six-pack because of hormones. However, having a slim waist is an indicator of fitness for both men and women.\n\nFor this reason, no amount of crunches or leg raises will make your abdominal muscles visible if your body fat is too high or if you don’t have the genetics for a visible six-pack.\n\nStop looking at those freaks online with popped-up abs like corn. Those people are not natural and maybe not even healthy. Yes, in some cases having such shredded abs is not healthy, especially for women.\n\nAsk any woman with a shredded si-pack if her menstrual cycle and libido are in the correct parameters. I guarantee you they are not.\n\nI am lucky enough to have the visible six-pack genetics. For starters, I store most of my fat on my hips, and second, I have popped up abs without doing crunches.\n\nI only do leg raises with the main goal of making my core stronger. I know that I am better off walking for 10 minutes than doing core exercises to make my abs visible.\n\nAb workouts also don’t burn body fat around your abs. Spot reduction is a myth. The body (hormones and genetics) decides where to burn body fat.\n\nIf you want just to have a visible six-pack or just a slim waist, stop doing ab workouts and start burning more calories to lose the body fat around your waist.";e[0]=d;return {staticAssetsBase:"\u002F_nuxt\u002Fstatic\u002F1636052233",layout:"default",error:null,state:{layout:{drawer:a,links:[{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fhealth",icon:"mdi-heart",title:"Health"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffitness",icon:"mdi-dumbbell",title:b},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffood",icon:"mdi-nutrition",title:"Food"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ffinance",icon:"mdi-finance",title:"Finance"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fsocial",icon:"mdi-account-group",title:"Social"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Fself-development",icon:"mdi-lightbulb",title:"Self-development"},{url:"\u002Fcategories\u002Ftech",icon:"mdi-application-cog",title:"Tech"}],pageTitle:c,"mutation-types":{}},articles:{article:d,articles:e,searchQuery:"","mutation-types":{},searchedArticles:e,isSearching:a}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fstop-doing-this-if-you-want-a-six-pack",config:{}}}(false,"Fitness","Stop Doing This If You Want A Six-Pack",{},Array(1)));
