I eat five whole eggs and six egg whites every day in the morning. No, **egg yolks don't raise your cholesterol**. People with high cholesterol have high cholesterol without even eating a lot of cholesterol (I said cholesterol too many times on one sentence).\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, if you eat 15 egg yolks every day may not be healthy; everything in excess is unhealthy.\r\n\r\nShort side note, the reason I eat six eggs white is for calories and protein. Egg whites have fewer calories and more protein than egg yolks.\r\n\r\nMake sure your eggs are **free-range (code 1) or organic (code 0)**. I found that organic eggs are not so different, if not worse, than free-range eggs. I no longer believe in organic things on this planet because pollution is everywhere, and most living beings are affected. The best choice you can make is to buy local and in season or frozen.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGetting back to the purpose of this article, I use five whole eggs and six egg whites to make my morning omelet. **I use a granite skillet** and **avocado oil spray.** You can use any oil you want, but I recommend using one of these oils for cooking as they don't get oxidized at high temperatures: animal fat (butter, lard, tallow), coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI spray quickly for six times, which is equal to two-three teaspoons of oil. I let the skillet heat, and I add the beaten eggs. Now the big secret: I let the **heat low and cover the skillet.** I cook the eggs for five minutes and then cut the omelet in quarters and flip them one by one. They look like pancakes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, you can use as many eggs as you want, but the main idea is to let the heat low and cover the skillet to avoid the temperature from leaving fast.

Even our families rarely understand.\r\n\r\n*\"Come on! It's good! It's just (you name it)\"* - they say.\r\nThey also say: *\"Why don't you eat this or that recipe? It's good!\"*\r\n\r\nTheir definition of good food or meal is opposite to my (our) definition of good. **When people say \"it's good,\" they mean it tastes good**. And this is where it all starts to go wrong.\r\n\r\n# Eatable, not too delicious or distasteful\r\n\r\nPeople only eat the food that tastes good, regardless of its source, quality, preparation methods, and so on. It is why it's so hard to eat food made at home.\r\n\r\n**Homemade (real) food doesn't have that intense taste as processed food does because it lacks MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)**. MSG is a taste enhancer which is present in all fast-foods and packaged ready-to-eat meals.\r\n\r\nHowever, real food has also lost its taste through time because the soils are depleted of minerals and real food lacks the nutrients it once had. You know what I mean; that tomato without taste that used to have 20 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it's not our fault. **We eat food that tastes (and smells) good because of a defense mechanism we developed through millions of years.** Back then, food that smelled and tasted terrible was not digestible or even poisoning.\r\n\r\nToday, we have science and other methods to determine which food is good or bad without using our senses. Also, some foods taste bad but are good for us. For instance, medicinal mushrooms taste horrible but are incredibly healthy in small doses.\r\n\r\nNow, I am not saying we should eat food that tastes bad but eat food that is a little beat higher than neutral at the taste. Not too good and not bad; just right.\r\n\r\n**Food that tastes too good is also addictive**, and most of the time, we eat it for pleasure, not because we are hungry, which leads us to the next key point.\r\n\r\n# Only when truly hungry\r\n\r\nOur body knows when we are starving, and that is the only time when we should eat. That's how every species on the planet has been doing it from the beginning of time. Hunt, catch the pray (if possible), eat, and then wait until the next hunt (1-3 days).\r\n\r\nThe exception is, of course, herbivores and animals living in the tropics which have food all seasons, but even they have to fight for their food with their lives as they are the primary hunting target for predators.\r\n\r\nWe now eat when we work, when we watch a movie or show, when we go out, when we are bored, when the clock ticks the time, when we are sad, when we are happy, when we are depressed, when we are angry, when we are thirsty, when we pass by a local food joint, etc.\r\n\r\nWe rarely eat when we need to and what we need to.\r\n\r\n# What nourishes our body\r\n\r\nI think 75% of the population is not aware of this crucial point. Food is not belly-filling or hunger-inhibitor. **Food is nourishment and information.**\r\n\r\n**Food tells the body (DNA) what to become and what to pass to the next generation**. Yes, if you want healthy and beautiful children, be careful of what you eat at least five years before.\r\n\r\nIf we eat crappy or good for nothing food, we become crappy and good for nothing, and we pass crappy and good for nothing genes to our children.\r\n\r\n**Good quality food is the food with the most essential nutrients** (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and other phytochemicals) **per kilocalorie** (fresh or freshly frozen vegetables, fruit, and wild or pasture-raised animal meat.)\r\n\r\nAll processed foods are high in calories and low in essential nutrients. That is why people are diabetic, obese, sick, and tired.\r\n\r\nSee food as nourishment and energy, not as sensorial-pleasing, belly-filling, digestible products.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n- **choose (generally) homemade meals** (shop regularly);\r\n- **meals should be eatable (natural taste)**, not too tasty or disgusting;\r\n- **eat only when truly hungry**, not when food is in sight, by emotion, or by schedule;\r\n- **choose food with the most essential nutrients per kilocalorie**.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***\r\n"};d[7]={author:b,title:"Ashwagandha: The Antistress Energizing Herb",id:"ashwagandha",createdOn:"Aug 29, 2019",categories:"Health, Food",description:"Ashwagandha, Withania Somnifera, or Indian Ginseng is a  medicinal root that has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine for immunity, stress-relief, and stamina.",image:"https:\u002F\u002Ffirebasestorage.googleapis.com\u002Fv0\u002Fb\u002Flifestyle-maniacs.appspot.com\u002Fo\u002Fimages%2Fashwagandha%2F_main.jpg?alt=media&token=fb0b3f8c-1f19-4cfd-8101-96da0f8dbaaf",imageCredit:"Photo by Adrian Swancar on Unsplash",imageCreditUrl:"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fphotos\u002FroCfgvkBLVY",_meta:{resourcePath:"D:\\Development\\lifestylemaniacs\\contents\\ashwagandha.md"},markdown:"Ashwagandha, Withania Somnifera, or Indian Ginseng is a medicinal root that has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine for **immunity, stress-relief, and stamina**.\r\n\r\nAshwagandha is an **adaptogenic herb** that helps us cope with stress.
