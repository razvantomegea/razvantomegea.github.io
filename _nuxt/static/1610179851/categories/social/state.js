I have no person in my family who is truly happy, nor a friend. My friends and I are young and still a work in progress, but even so, something is missing. We never seem to get enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor a while, I used to be happy with my life. Then I met people. In my shell, I saw only the beauty of life: I was healthy, and I had enough money to take care of myself. I was alone, though, but I didn't care.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSomething happened, and I realized I couldn't live alone anymore. Life without relationships around is an empty life. I started going out and reconnecting with people and, at the same time, gently lost confidence in myself.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI never understood why I lost my self-confidence and why I am still struggling to be as confident as possible. After digging within, searching for an answer, I found something interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow come I have everything a man wants in life, and everything achieved by myself, but still no confidence? Because I don't realize who I am and how much I have achieved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI realized I was comparing myself with others. I thought other people are higher than me and more successful, and I thought I was not enough and not doing enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am not other people. I am me, and I have my path. I need to accept myself as I am and live my own life as it is. I need to make my life heaven in my way. It applies to you and everyone around you.\r\n\r\n# Accept Who You Are\r\n\r\nAccept yourself as you are because you are unique and beautiful as you are. I don't mean to stop improving yourself. I mean, do what you can to achieve your goals and be happy with your achievements.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't make you genuinely happy, don't even think of trying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI see people unhappy because they spend too much time on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, and whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people traveling and exotic places and wish to be there instead of where they are now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see actors and singers with fancy close and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see expensive cars and houses and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people with perfect bodies and faces and wished they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn other words, people hate their lives and want to escape through movies and social media. It makes me sad that social media and television manipulate us into working our lives for money and then spending on things we don't need and on which we never have the time to enjoy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe don't need all the crap they lie to us we need. We need a minimalistic life with as little stuff as possible and as much quality people and health as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am not saying we don't need to aspire. We need to set goals and aspirations. What we don't need is put them on a pedestal and make them a requirement for our happiness.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPeople in Africa who have little water, food, and shelter are happier than us. They are not aware of what the media tells us we need to live a happy life and are too worried about survival than spending time wondering: \"what could have been if?\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n# Know Thyself\r\n\r\nEvery article has a purpose, not just to help and inform others but to help me better understand myself and my thoughts. I am not a writer but a reader and \"speak\" to myself too.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a lot to learn, and I am my mentor. I don't do it because I saw others doing it; I do it as a self-therapy and a growth opportunity, because I know myself better and clear my mind.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nKnow yourself and accept yourself as you are with all your imperfections. It doesn't matter if others tell you your tall, short, skinny, fat, ugly, poor, weird, or what have you. All these are attributes exist as long as you compare yourself with others.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout comparison, you are perfect as you are. If you can improve, good, otherwise, accept yourself as you are. Trust yourself and be confident as f*ck.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[1]={id:"is-a-six-pack-worth-it",author:a,title:"Is A Six-Pack Worth It?

It is easy when you're living alone and isolated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI've isolated myself for five years to focus on my career, health, and fitness, and it has cost me dearly. I've lost my social skills, and I can come as anti-social. I am not anti-social, not anymore at least, but I have a little social anxiety. If I think about it, I am causing my discomfort because I don't have my food, and I am not in my habitat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy obsessions with being fit all the time prevent me from having fun and feeling good from time to time on weekends. As hard as I am trying to hide this, people can tell, and it is not cool.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, because of my trauma from childhood when I was overweight, I have come to believe that only if I were to be fit could I be accepted in society. It sucks how some childhood trauma can affect your entire life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI managed to make a balance between social life and my goals through portion control. If we think about it, if I eat correctly five-six days per week, on day of cheating won't do any harm if done correctly. I know that fatty foods are the enemy, so I always eat the slimmest food on the table. When it comes to alcohol, I also choose low-calorie alcohol drinks and avoid soft drinks (I don't like them).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf anything slim or low calorie is available, I consume small, minimal, portions, just enough to not be impolite, because that's what is all about.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go off-road from your plan a day per week, but then you are back on track the following six days, it is perfect. **If the long-term trend is up, it doesn't matter if, from time to time, there are some short-term downtrends**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the end, we are social beings, and **we cannot sacrifice our social life for anything in the world. It doesn't matter if you are rich, famous, fit, and good looking if you are alone and have no one with whom to share your success and happiness.** With patience and dedication, we can balance everything. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[2]={id:"why-bad-boys-end-up-with-the-girl-and-how-to-be-better",author:a,title:"Why Bad Boys End Up With The Girl And How To Be Better",createdOn:"Oct 2, 2020",categories:"Social, Self-development",description:"I was always a nice guy with people around me, including girls and women.

Nice guys have expectations; they are needy. Nice guys give to receive and keep count of everything they do. Their **self-identity and self-respect depend on others'** opinions and validations. Nice guys want to please with the hope that people around will appreciate them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIs it just me, or is it pathetic? Maybe you have friends around who are people pleasers and always seem awkward. It makes sense to me why, for a while, people didn't want to be around me, especially girls. Back then, my mind could not understand this. How can a girl or woman say: \"You're so nice!\" and at the same time: \"but I see you as a friend\" and run with the asshole that doesn't give a shit about her?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt all goes back to the primal brain. **Females are programmed to sick the alpha male, the fittest male, to pass their genes to the offspring.** The alpha male was the biggest and strongest from a physical standpoint. It made sense because females needed protection and leadership in a dangerous environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe are not that different from the primal human because our brain is like an onion: it adds new layers of gray matter, but the core brain remains. Thus, the first **reptilian brain focused on survival (food, water, shelter, reproduction) is still there.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, the **strongest male is the strongest from a mental and emotional standpoint.** It makes sense because women need emotional and psychological support. Between the nice guy and bad boy, the bad boy is the winner from this perspective.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBad boys have **self-respect and a strong knowledge of who they are.** They **know what they want** in life and go after it. They are **well on their own** because their **self-identity and self-esteem are independent of others**. They are always themselves around others and without inhibitions. Bad boys **put themselves first** before others, have **high self-confidence and self-control**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSee the pattern here? Nice guys are the exact opposite. Now, bad boys have some negative traits: they **tend to be arrogant, self-centered, and with little empathy**. Bad boys may use people for their self-interest. It is why bad boys don't care about women, because it is not their goal. Also, very important, **bad boys don't focus on the little things**. In other words, they **don't give a shit about anything but themselves**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRemember the Tony Stark from Iron Man reference in the beginning? Well, Tony Stark, in the beginning, was a bad boy - a player - but he changed and realized the qualities of a superhero.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are not aware of their primal desires and **cannot explain why they are sexually attracted to the guy who doesn't give a shit about her**. Women also test their man throughout their life to check if he is still a man and can resist under pressure or if he is the real deal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you don't have to be either of them, as they are both extremes. What you need to be is a real man and not just any man, but your version of a real man.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**A real man is a merge between a nice guy and a bad boy**. A real man has the good qualities of the bad boy (confidence, goals, self-control, independence, courage, emotional and psychological stability), and the good qualities of the nice guy: empathy, self-less, compassion, and love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA real man is like a superhero, but without the cape and the mutant powers: he uses his qualities to help others without receiving back, is courageous and responsible. He is an example for others.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I started to learn how to be a man, I put on a fake bad boy mask. It was when I began dating my girlfriend, but she felt I was not myself. She even told me: \"I like you better now (yourself) than in the beginning\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, nice guys are not themselves; they put masks because they are not comfortable with who they are. **You don't have to be a bad boy if it is not in your genes**, because it is not natural for you. Just be yourself but with some improvements.\r\n\r\n# Takeaways\r\n\r\n-   believe in yourself;\r\n-   don't give to receive;\r\n-   don't care what others think about you unless they give you constructive advice;\r\n-   develop self-control and inner toughness;\r\n-   don't expect validation from others;\r\n-   have the courage to say what you feel and think;\r\n-   be responsible for your actions and make decisions;\r\n-   make yourself a priority, but don't hurt people around you in the process;\r\n-   ignore the little things and don't overanalyze;\r\n-   learn from your mistakes and move on;\r\n-   grow some b**ls and harden your spine.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[3]={id:"the-most-important-thing-in-a-relationship",author:a,title:"The Most Important Thing In A Relationship",createdOn:"Sep 25, 2020",categories:e,description:"I can't say I've been in a relationship for a long time like other people, but I can say I've never been happier in a relationship.

If you can accomplish this, you'll be happy forever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, relationships will never be perfect. Two people cannot be the same, and they need to find the middle way for them to be happy. There are periods of ups and downs, like everything else in life. I learned that **the downs are the ones that either strengthen the relationship, either weaken it.** It depends on the two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf the couple wants to be together, they will find a way to make it work no matter what. All it takes is **good communication**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf in a relationship you communicate, you will find a solution to everything. Just listen to what the other has to say and try to understand. You both have different histories and experiences, and it is ok to be different.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou were probably raised differently, have different opinions, have different tastes; it is ok. If you communicate, discuss, in a calm fashion, without yelling, fighting, or breaking things in the house, everything will work out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe **lack of communication determines the couple to have secrets**, to cheat, and treat each other disrespectfully. It may be out of fear of avoiding conflict. It happens to me often, but I realize I am better off explaining what is on my mind and chest and try to fix it. Again, calm and understand are the go-to.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo one likes to be yelled at or to be told what to do; it is human nature.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you feel your woman or man doesn't respect you, it is not their fault. People, in general, **treat you the way you treat yourself**. People feel when you don't love and respect yourself: if you respect yourself, they will respect you; if you love yourself, they will love you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy mother, the God rest her soul, had a saying: **\"Life is like a mirror: if you smile at it, it will smile back to you, so, smile!\"**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore going into any relationship, **learn to be man - or woman, respect, and love yourself**, because you deserve it.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***"};f[4]={id:"what-women-really-want",author:a,title:"What Women Really Want?",createdOn:"Sep 15, 2020",categories:b,description:"They say that Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, died with this question in mind.

It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it. You are making me feel bad,\" then this is not how a man reacts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you can say is: \"Yeah! I am like a pig. Be a good girl and scratch my belly from time to time, won't you?\" and laugh about it. You can also say: \"I don't know. I kind of look sexy with this belly.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGot the idea? The idea is: **don't take her seriously**. Always be prepared to make a laugh of her complaints towards you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBe careful, though. There are times when you must take her seriously. If she tells you not to stop leaving your underwear on the floor, then you have to listen to her. In this case, you can make fun of yourself by smiling and saying: \"Oh man. My bad. I forgot to tell you that we have a pig in the house. I will go and put him back in his cage.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, you make fun of your mistakes, but still, you will keep in mind to improve. You also made each other laugh about the issue.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe point is, **don't be intimidated by her and don't make her your queen**. She is your woman, and you are her man.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nWe men are rational beings. We always try to find patterns and some sense in everything. Women, however, are emotional beings. They behave and act based on their current emotional state (mood).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring periods of pressure, blood flows differently in the brains of men and women. **In women, blood flows more in the limbic system,** the emotional brain**, whereas in men, blood flows more in the prefrontal cortex,** the part of the brain involved in decision making and problem-solving. [[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2007\u002F11\u002F071119170133.htm)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt makes sense now why **during stress, women make no sense**. The part of the brain involved in emotions overrides the part of the brain involved in rationality. Women are overwhelmed by their feelings, and that is why we, as men, need to be emotionally stable. We need to be there for them and support them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext time she complaints about something or over-reacts, understand that it is not her fault. If her mood is changing, realize that it is her natural dynamic. Don't take it personally as if it is your fault. Be a man for your woman, because that is what she wants.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   women are hard-wired to seek financial, emotional, mental, and physical security, so, they will look for these features in a man;\r\n-   women want their men to be strong mentally, emotionally, and physically, so, they will test them and try to make them stronger;\r\n-   women are emotional beings (limbic system-oriented), whereas men are rational beings (prefrontal cortex-oriented). It is why women make no sense from time to time;\r\n-   women make their decisions and change their mood based on their current emotional state; we, as men, must show strength, calm, and confidence for them and support them.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

She also never told people what bothered her about them, especially to her children. She kept everything inside and talked behind other people's backs. Her entire life, my grandmother, was worried and was affected by anything.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that **the most critical factor of the disease is the emotional and psychological part**; the physical part (e.g., exercise, sleep, nutrition, sunlight, etc.) is the last.\r\n\r\n# Love and put yourself first\r\n\r\nFor a few years, I got influenced by my grandmother to be the same: don't love myself, don't appreciate myself, don't accept myself, put others before me. From my experience, this is a big mistake. One out of a thousand people will appreciate this sacrifice; the rest will only use you and walk over you like a bug.\r\n  \r\n**How can you expect others to love and respect you when you can't do it yourself?**\r\n\r\nNeediness is insecurity and lack of confidence. **A needy person is a person who seeks approval and validation from other people because he\u002Fshe doesn't have a clear definition of who he\u002Fshe is and his\u002Fher worth.**\r\n\r\nLoving yourself, acknowledging who you are, doesn't make you a narcissist. Narcissists keep talking about themselves and keep reminding people of how important and, let's say, successful they are (in their mind). Confident people know their values and keep it for themselves so that whatever other people think and say, they are not affected.\r\n\r\n# Your growth is your (first) goal\r\n\r\nI am still working on my confidence because I still have insecurities because of my past, so I am not a perfect example of a confident man. I am not writing because I think I am perfect. I am writing to give people hope that they are not alone. We are and always be imperfect, and everything we see on tv and the web is fake.\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing these days is to be authentic because everybody is trying to fit you in the same basket of apples. No, you are not weird, broken, weak, or hopeless. You are you and were born here for a purpose. Believe in yourself no matter what, and you will be happy.

I see so many people getting married and getting divorced in less than ten years. I also see men and women ran away like road runner when they hear of something serious.\r\n\r\nWe live in fucked up times, and our hormones are also fucked up. Maybe this is one of the big causes of a relationship crisis.\r\n\r\nBack in my high school years, I was a player. I liked hooking up with every girl I found attractive. It was a great feeling, but come on now... I was a kid.\r\n\r\nAfter my father met another woman and got married, I got into a depression. I lived alone for five years and lost my self-confidence. This had a big impact on my further social life, including sex life.\r\n\r\nA year ago, I started hanging out again and seeing new faces. My biggest problem was my self-confidence because I didn't believe in myself almost at all. I was looking for validation and became needy, and people feel these things.\r\n\r\nWe are all connected in ways we cannot understand. We are 99.99% energy, and we all vibrate at different frequencies and radiate various energy fields. We immediately feel when a person has high energy or low energy.\r\n\r\nA needy, insecure person like my past self repels people, especially women, from their lives. We usually repel what we need the most. In other words, we repel what we feel we lack or what we think we are not worthy of. That's why we need validation. We don't acknowledge our values.\r\n\r\nYou are awesome, remember that. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. You need to show it to yourself and repeat it every day. I challenge you do write down at least 10 of your best values and achievements.\r\n\r\nThe moment you begin to feel your awesomeness without the need to say it out loud, the world around you will change. Life will be beautiful.\r\n\r\nDon't chase people and things; make them chase you by believing you are worthy of anything. Trust yourself and the Universe. \r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it! I hope you enjoyed it and be sure to share it with your friends and stay tuned for upcoming quality posts.

Be The Change!",createdOn:"Oct 04, 2019",categories:b,description:"People don't like being told what to do, especially with the wrong tone. It is in our human nature that we chase some validation.

I guess I am similar to my father on this side. If someone ever told me to do something with an authoritative tone, I would do precisely the opposite. Even if I intended to do that exact requested thing, I would still not do it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, people hate smart guys. People don't like being told what to do, especially with the wrong tone. It is in our human nature that we chase some validation. However, when someone gives a piece of advice, we, most of the time, get offensive.\r\n\r\nIt is the ego that is trying to protect our self-esteem. It is the ego that makes us feel entitled.\r\n\r\nI remember that when I was a kid, my grandparents used o tell me to dress up to avoid catching a cold. \"Son, you will fill this when you get older.\" You know what a child response to that? \"Yeah, right! I will be fine! It won't happen to me.\" Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nOf most people, children hate being told what to do. They do the opposite of what rules are saying.\r\n\r\nHow can we then teach children and other people something good for themselves without being offended?\r\n\r\n# Mirror neurons\r\n\r\nMirror neurons are specialized neurons that trigger the same actions (impulses) observed in another subject. They make us **copy an observed activity**.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you go to the gym or see somebody working out, you suddenly feel like doing the same thing. You get into the zone or groove. This copying of state is the effect o mirror neurons firing.\r\n\r\nIf I think about it, when I was a child, I used to copy everything my father did. Unfortunately, I copied some bad habits too, like smoking and drinking - I quit early, no worries. My father was an example for me.\r\n\r\nMy father knew I was smoking, yet he never told me to quit smoking because he couldn't. He was also smoking and couldn't stop, so how could he ask me to do what he never could?\r\n\r\nYou see, we cannot force people to change just because we think it is the right thing to do, especially when we cannot do it ourselves. It would be selfish and hypocritical of us. What we can and should do is to **be an example.**\r\n\r\nMahatma Gandhi was right: **\"be the change you want to see in the world.\"**\r\n\r\nWe first need to change ourselves. I want young people to take better care of their health, so I am taking very care of myself. I want people to see what being healthy looks and feels. In the end, it should be their choice. Who knows, maybe some people like being sick.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have to make people aware of some facts, but it should be done friendly, with a soft tone, and only after we have already done it. Afterward, it is their responsibility and choice to change. We need to inspire through example (action) and give advice (help) only when asked.\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!
