You probably learned the basics; if not, I encourage you to watch some [YouTube videos](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fresults?search_query=coin+bureau+technical+analysis), take some [courses](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.xtb.com\u002Fen\u002Flearn-to-trade), or read a [book](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCharting-Technical-Analysis-Fred-McAllen-ebook\u002Fdp\u002FB007PRECN2\u002Fref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1620459299&sr=8-1) on this topic. I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n\u003E Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n\u003E Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short\u002FMedium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short\u002Fmedium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n\u003E There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n\u003E Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n\u003E Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https:\u002F\u002Fcdn-images-1.medium.com\u002Fmax\u002F1000\u002F1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20\u002F50\u002F200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.
