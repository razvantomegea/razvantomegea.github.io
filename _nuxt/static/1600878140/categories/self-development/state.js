My grandmother keeps saying that because she has a small pension. Unfortunately for her and other people in my country, their pensions stay the same, but the costs increase year after year.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs a comparison, people with Ph.Ds and degrees in some domains have big pensions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, is a degree the absolute requirement for a good life? The answer is: it **depends on your personality and goals**. How come?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn my country, there are a lot of people with only maybe eight classes and have expensive cars and huge houses. They didn't even go to high school but have more money than a Ph.D.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI also learned from \"[Rich Dad](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fchannel\u002FUCuifm5ns5SRG8LZJ6gCfKyw)\" that you don't need to go to school to make money because they don't teach money in school.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to make money, you don't need a college necessarily, but there is a catch: you need to be **self-disciplined and a risk-taker**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's be honest: it is much easier and safer to work as an employee; you have a stable and guaranteed monthly payment. Keep in mind, though, that **working as an employee is not that guaranteed** as you think. I know people who were very dedicated and respected at their workplace, and still lost their jobs because the company needed to cut back on expenses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is what happened this year because of the pandemic. Millions of people lost their jobs, not because they did something wrong, but because business began to fail. I lost colleagues because the company lost a client and had to cut down expenses, and I fear that it cand happen to me someday.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live in days in which it is more important how you look than who you are or what you do. Hence, **you need a college if you want to be an employee** because the certificate is required.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a degree in computer science, but I don't consider myself a computer engineer because I know almost nothing about electronics and physics. I never liked them because I didn't have good teachers in school (that's my excuse, at least). I consider myself a software engineer, though.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I learned to code mostly at home, watching youtube videos**, and writing a lot of small apps. I have a passion for web development, which, funny enough, college didn't teach me anything about it. I am self-taught. Now, I work as a web developer, and people keep recruiting me on LinkedIn for web development positions. It wouldn't have happened if I didn't have had a computer science diploma.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn LinkedIn, **recruiters don't look at you**, or you don't even appear in search results **if you don't have a degree and certificate** in something. It doesn't matter if you master any domain; **you need a certificate for the employers to pay you properly** and to maintain your position. It is how the system works.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only case where knowledge without proof on paper makes sense is when you create your own business, and you are your boss. If you **have a business idea, you are a hard-worker, you are disciplined, and are willing to risk, then college is just an obstacle in your way** and a waste of time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is better, though, to have a plan B. In case your business fails, what will you do? Also, **starting a business requires capital, and it takes years until you make some money** out of it. Where will you get the money until then? If you have some wealthy parents, good for you. Few are that lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCollege is useful as a starting point and backup for whatever happens, but don't put your faith in it too much. You will still have to research and learn on your own in college as well because no one will push you as teachers did in school.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI had my first job as a grocery shop seller during the summer. Afterward, I worked as a waiter, then in a tv show audience, then as a factory worker, then, for the first time, as a software quality tester. The latter was my first job in my software development career. Now, I am a free-lancer in software development and trying to develop some business of my own, including to invest.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started at the Employee cashflow quadrant, moved to the Self-employed quadrant, and now moving slowly to the Investor quadrant, and maybe even to the Big Business. \"The Cashflow Quadrant\" is another book by Robert Kiyosaki that I read and recommend it.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   college is required if you want to be a well-paid employee (stability and some guarantee);\r\n-   we don't learn money in school, so we don't need school to make money;\r\n-   starting a business requires a good idea, self-discipline, hard work, capital, patience, and guts (know your personality type);\r\n-   the best option is to have a plan B; begin as an employee and move gradually towards the forth cashflow quadrant, the big business.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Do you have something you need to accomplish, but you can seem to put yourself to do the work? Is it an exam, a project, or just the usual daily chores?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis delaying of duties is called procrastination. Funny enough, we are still procrastinating even though we know we still need to do it in the future. How can this happen? How can we fool ourselves in avoiding the inevitable?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is something deep down in our human nature.\r\n\r\n# Energy preservation\r\n\r\nFor millions of years, human beings have been fighting with survival. Food was not always at our disposal like today, and we didn't have the privilege to access anything at just one click distance.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack then, everything required our energy. Our energy was critical, and we needed to be careful with how we spent it. Thus, **we are programmed to preserve our energy** as much as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccomplishing tasks requires both physical and mental energy. Our conservatory body, especially our brain, is fighting to avoid any energy waste. It is why we find it so hard to put ourselves to work. **Our body has programmed us to be lazy.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are tricks to fool our brains into doing the work.\r\n\r\n# Focus on the first step\r\n\r\nUsually, when we try to convince ourselves to do tasks, **we think of the entire process at once**. If we have more than one thing to do, we think of all of them at once and try to calculate every step in our minds.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe process of analyzing every step in our minds becomes overwhelming. I don't know about you, but for me, it is stressful and makes me anxious.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I found is that **if I focus only on the first step, then everything flows on its own.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is always the hardest because it is the one step that makes us get into the zone.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhenever I want to write some code, and I don't feel like it, I trick myself by saying: \"I will just sit at the desk, open the programming tool and write one line of code.\" Hours pass by, and one line becomes 100 lines.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther tasks that were hard for me in the past now have become routines that I do on autopilot. Tasks like exercising, cooking, shopping, laundry, etc. are now automatic and don't require any mental energy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, whatever you need to do, focus only on the first step. If you need to study, just set the goal to sit down and open the book. If you need to do your homework, focus on sitting at your desk, and doing one exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can also look at it like this: **you know you will do it sometime, so why avoid the inevitable?**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in school, I liked to do my homework on Friday, because then I knew my entire weekend would be free and be relaxed. On the other hand, if I let my work for the last moment, then my mind would be only there, and wouldn't have enjoyed my free time to the fullest.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, if you accept that **there is no escaping from what you need to do**, you will do it anyway. What you can do is enjoying the process and make it fun. If you have a lot of time to accomplish it, **start early, and set small goals every day**. For instance, in college, I started studying since the first week and set myself the goal to read one page per day. It was easy for me to accomplish that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe have become a comfortable society that avoids discomfort and seeks constant pleasure. The living organism was designed to grow (evolve) only in acute stress (pain). It is why muscles grow after stressing them.\r\n\r\nThe only way to achieve growth is by **accepting pain as something natural and beneficial in our lives.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   focus on the first task, not the entire job at once;\r\n-   develop routines and do tasks automatically without thinking;\r\n-   stop running from the inevitable;\r\n-   accept pain as a natural and beneficial part of life.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it. You are making me feel bad,\" then this is not how a man reacts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you can say is: \"Yeah! I am like a pig. Be a good girl and scratch my belly from time to time, won't you?\" and laugh about it. You can also say: \"I don't know. I kind of look sexy with this belly.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGot the idea? The idea is: **don't take her seriously**. Always be prepared to make a laugh of her complaints towards you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBe careful, though. There are times when you must take her seriously. If she tells you not to stop leaving your underwear on the floor, then you have to listen to her. In this case, you can make fun of yourself by smiling and saying: \"Oh man. My bad. I forgot to tell you that we have a pig in the house. I will go and put him back in his cage.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, you make fun of your mistakes, but still, you will keep in mind to improve. You also made each other laugh about the issue.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe point is, **don't be intimidated by her and don't make her your queen**. She is your woman, and you are her man.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nWe men are rational beings. We always try to find patterns and some sense in everything. Women, however, are emotional beings. They behave and act based on their current emotional state (mood).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring periods of pressure, blood flows differently in the brains of men and women. **In women, blood flows more in the limbic system,** the emotional brain**, whereas in men, blood flows more in the prefrontal cortex,** the part of the brain involved in decision making and problem-solving. [[1]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sciencedaily.com\u002Freleases\u002F2007\u002F11\u002F071119170133.htm)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt makes sense now why **during stress, women make no sense**. The part of the brain involved in emotions overrides the part of the brain involved in rationality. Women are overwhelmed by their feelings, and that is why we, as men, need to be emotionally stable. We need to be there for them and support them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext time she complaints about something or over-reacts, understand that it is not her fault. If her mood is changing, realize that it is her natural dynamic. Don't take it personally as if it is your fault. Be a man for your woman, because that is what she wants.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   women are hard-wired to seek financial, emotional, mental, and physical security, so, they will look for these features in a man;\r\n-   women want their men to be strong mentally, emotionally, and physically, so, they will test them and try to make them stronger;\r\n-   women are emotional beings (limbic system-oriented), whereas men are rational beings (prefrontal cortex-oriented). It is why women make no sense from time to time;\r\n-   women make their decisions and change their mood based on their current emotional state; we, as men, must show strength, calm, and confidence for them and support them.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

You may think that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates have enough money, but they don't. These guys are at another level. They no longer see money as we do - spending potential. They see money as capital for investments. It is how they made their fortune.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there you have it. If you want to increase your wealth, start investing. Easy, right? Surely not. Investing requires some **financial education, some capital, and lots of patience**. A lot of us don't have these qualities, but we can earn them.\r\n\r\n# Financial education\r\n\r\nFinancial education teaches us about money and how to earn it smartly. I recommend reading **\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\"** written by Robert Kiyosaki and **\"The Richest Man In Babylon,\"** written by George Clason**.** The biggest lesson I learned from these books is the value of making money work for you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, we are taught in school to work for money, but these books teach us to make money work for us. It is how top Forbes successful people did it and continue to do it. It is straightforward for them, but not for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou must be asking now: how can I make money work for me if I don't have any? Shouldn't I work for money first to earn them? It depends on your character. Many **successful investors invest money which isn't theirs**. You can do it too if you have the guts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor example, you can borrow money, invest, make some profit, payback, and reinvest your profit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOthers start their own business and then invest, but this is still the same concept: **make money work for you.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is to educate yourself on finances. Learn everything you can about how money works. You can start with the two books mentioned above and with \"The Rich Dad Channel\" on Youtube.\r\n\r\n# Personal finance management\r\n\r\nIt is the point of this article and the first step in making money: cash-flow. Where does your money go? Do you buy more liabilities (cars, clothes, parties) than assets (real estate, commodities, businesses)? Do you save money every month, or do you spend mindlessly?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTaking **control of your finances is the first step in making money** work for you. If every month you remain with 0 and you depend on the next salary, then you are not doing something right. You are consuming too much. I advise you to lower your consumption or increase your income so that every month you **save at least 10% of your income.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSaving 10% every month is not that big a deal, but makes a big difference in the long run as you increase your capital. Having capital is the initial step in investing and making money work for you.\r\n\r\n# **Investments**\r\n\r\nNow that you have a capital, you must make it work for you. If you keep on **saving money without investing, it will depreciate** as inflation increases every year. This year will be the worst in the last two centuries as the pandemic affects the global economy, especially the US economy and dollar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn important question is where to invest?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI started taking a look at the stock market, commodities, and ETFs. I lost a pretty lot of money before I educated myself enough. I advise you to be prudent and learn from my mistakes. **Don't invest in something you don't understand**. You can also make a bank savings deposit that pays annual interest rates.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDo your research and choose something with minimum risk and in which you feel confident.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   save 10% of your income every month;\r\n-   start reading financial education books;\r\n-   invest smartly.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.\r\n\r\n-   the economy is about to crash;\r\n-   people die and are sick all around the planet;\r\n-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;\r\n-   some of us are unemployed;\r\n-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.\r\n\r\n# 1. Health is the most critical asset\r\n\r\nI learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.\r\n\r\nIt is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.\r\n\r\nTake care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**\r\n\r\nWe are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. \r\n\r\nAll I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.\r\n\r\nOur immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.\r\n\r\nYou see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:\r\n\r\n-   avoid closed and public areas;\r\n-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;\r\n-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;\r\n-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;\r\n-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);\r\n-   limit alcohol and smoking;\r\n-   eat real food and limit processed food;\r\n-   drink plenty of water;\r\n-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);\r\n-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;\r\n-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.\r\n\r\n# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it\r\n\r\nThere was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.\r\n\r\n**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**\r\n\r\nMy advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.\r\n\r\n# 3. Be prepared for anything\r\n\r\nI am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.\r\n\r\n-   I invested in a minimal home gym;\r\n-   I take cold showers;\r\n-   I spend most time alone;\r\n-   I work remotely;\r\n-   I cook and prepare my food;\r\n-   I live a healthy lifestyle;\r\n-   I don't depend on my parents.\r\n\r\nI am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.\r\n\r\nLife is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.\r\n\r\n# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.\r\n\r\nWe need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.\r\n\r\nYou may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.\r\n\r\n**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**\r\n\r\nLife will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\n**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.\r\n\r\nNow, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.\r\n\r\n**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**\r\n\r\n# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true\r\n\r\nEverybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.\r\n\r\n**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**\r\n\r\nJust ask, \"why?\". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.\r\n\r\n**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.\r\n\r\nReporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.\r\n\r\n**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

She also never told people what bothered her about them, especially to her children. She kept everything inside and talked behind other people's backs. Her entire life, my grandmother, was worried and was affected by anything.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that **the most critical factor of the disease is the emotional and psychological part**; the physical part (e.g., exercise, sleep, nutrition, sunlight, etc.) is the last.\r\n\r\n# Love and put yourself first\r\n\r\nFor a few years, I got influenced by my grandmother to be the same: don't love myself, don't appreciate myself, don't accept myself, put others before me. From my experience, this is a big mistake. One out of a thousand people will appreciate this sacrifice; the rest will only use you and walk over you like a bug.\r\n  \r\n**How can you expect others to love and respect you when you can't do it yourself?**\r\n\r\nNeediness is insecurity and lack of confidence. **A needy person is a person who seeks approval and validation from other people because he\u002Fshe doesn't have a clear definition of who he\u002Fshe is and his\u002Fher worth.**\r\n\r\nLoving yourself, acknowledging who you are, doesn't make you a narcissist.

I am not writing because I think I am perfect. I am writing to give people hope that they are not alone. We are and always be imperfect, and everything we see on tv and the web is fake.\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing these days is to be authentic because everybody is trying to fit you in the same basket of apples. No, you are not weird, broken, weak, or hopeless. You are you and were born here for a purpose. Believe in yourself no matter what, and you will be happy.

I see so many people getting married and getting divorced in less than ten years. I also see men and women ran away like road runner when they hear of something serious.\r\n\r\nWe live in fucked up times, and our hormones are also fucked up. Maybe this is one of the big causes of a relationship crisis.\r\n\r\nBack in my high school years, I was a player. I liked hooking up with every girl I found attractive. It was a great feeling, but come on now... I was a kid.\r\n\r\nAfter my father met another woman and got married, I got into a depression. I lived alone for five years and lost my self-confidence. This had a big impact on my further social life, including sex life.\r\n\r\nA year ago, I started hanging out again and seeing new faces. My biggest problem was my self-confidence because I didn't believe in myself almost at all. I was looking for validation and became needy, and people feel these things.\r\n\r\nWe are all connected in ways we cannot understand. We are 99.99% energy, and we all vibrate at different frequencies and radiate various energy fields. We immediately feel when a person has high energy or low energy.\r\n\r\nA needy, insecure person like my past self repels people, especially women, from their lives. We usually repel what we need the most. In other words, we repel what we feel we lack or what we think we are not worthy of. That's why we need validation. We don't acknowledge our values.\r\n\r\nYou are awesome, remember that. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. You need to show it to yourself and repeat it every day. I challenge you do write down at least 10 of your best values and achievements.\r\n\r\nThe moment you begin to feel your awesomeness without the need to say it out loud, the world around you will change. Life will be beautiful.\r\n\r\nDon't chase people and things; make them chase you by believing you are worthy of anything.

The primary reason is that people have become too self-centered and mean to each other. Few people do something for others out of self-interest.\r\n\r\nThere are good people out there, but they are lost in the crowd. They concluded that it is a waste of time to be the right person in a world of selfishness, meanness, crime, robbery, etc. Is it now?\r\n\r\n# The Hard And Right Way\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that evil is the easy road. As you can see, anybody can do it. Being kind, on the other hand, is the hard path and the right path as well. Being kind, you emit love while consuming hate and pain. Being unkind, you emit hate and pain while consuming love from other people.\r\n\r\nWe need to be the change we want to see in the world. If we want the world to be a better place, we need to be better.\r\n\r\n# Karma and Reincarnation\r\n\r\nI believe in karma and the afterlife. You see, have you ever wondered why children are born with diseases or in poverty or without parents? I don't believe in bad luck or chance. The Universe has a purpose and a way of ordering things that we don't understand.\r\n\r\nYou see, the entire Universe is made of energy, including us; that's a fact. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. When we die, our energy is reused in the Universe for further forms of life or matter. The process of energy reuse is what reincarnation is all about.\r\n\r\nThere is also the idea that we go to heaven or hell, depending on the kind of people we were. I believe heaven and hell are just oxymorons for further lives. What do I mean by this? You see, we gain and put energy into the Universe through our words, actions, thoughts, and emotions. All that energy will turnaround in the next life.\r\n\r\nEverything we think, feel, and do is invested in the Universe. The Universe learns and evolves based on every individual's actions. It is like a machine learning algorithm. Every next epoch (life) is based on the previous epoch in order to learn what it is meant to learn.\r\n\r\n# The Bigger Picture\r\n\r\nBeing the right person is an investment; you struggle now, but will be happy and fulfilled later. Being the wrong person is exactly the opposite.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am hallucinating, or it is too Sci-Fy what I just discussed here, but for me, these ideas make me see the bigger picture. These ideas help me combine science and religion as they both indicate the same direction, but with different paths (words).\r\n\r\nI believe our sensory systems and perceptions are inputs through which the Universe (God) sees itself. The Universe learns through you and changes based on your thoughts and emotions - as within, so without.\r\n\r\nEvery living organism is a manifestation of the Universe, through which the Universe perceives itself from different points of view. We are all connected to the same source of consciousness. We are one.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is: **think, feel, and act like someone is always watching you because it is - you are - and treat every living organism like you would treat yourself because it is - we are one source of consciousness.**\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

I guess I am similar to my father on this side. If someone ever told me to do something with an authoritative tone, I would do precisely the opposite. Even if I intended to do that exact requested thing, I would still not do it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, people hate smart guys. People don't like being told what to do, especially with the wrong tone. It is in our human nature that we chase some validation. However, when someone gives a piece of advice, we, most of the time, get offensive.\r\n\r\nIt is the ego that is trying to protect our self-esteem. It is the ego that makes us feel entitled.\r\n\r\nI remember that when I was a kid, my grandparents used o tell me to dress up to avoid catching a cold. \"Son, you will fill this when you get older.\" You know what a child response to that? \"Yeah, right! I will be fine! It won't happen to me.\" Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nOf most people, children hate being told what to do. They do the opposite of what rules are saying.\r\n\r\nHow can we then teach children and other people something good for themselves without being offended?\r\n\r\n# Mirror neurons\r\n\r\nMirror neurons are specialized neurons that trigger the same actions (impulses) observed in another subject. They make us **copy an observed activity**.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you go to the gym or see somebody working out, you suddenly feel like doing the same thing. You get into the zone or groove. This copying of state is the effect o mirror neurons firing.\r\n\r\nIf I think about it, when I was a child, I used to copy everything my father did. Unfortunately, I copied some bad habits too, like smoking and drinking - I quit early, no worries. My father was an example for me.\r\n\r\nMy father knew I was smoking, yet he never told me to quit smoking because he couldn't. He was also smoking and couldn't stop, so how could he ask me to do what he never could?\r\n\r\nYou see, we cannot force people to change just because we think it is the right thing to do, especially when we cannot do it ourselves. It would be selfish and hypocritical of us. What we can and should do is to **be an example.**\r\n\r\nMahatma Gandhi was right: **\"be the change you want to see in the world.\"**\r\n\r\nWe first need to change ourselves. I want young people to take better care of their health, so I am taking very care of myself. I want people to see what being healthy looks and feels. In the end, it should be their choice. Who knows, maybe some people like being sick.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have to make people aware of some facts, but it should be done friendly, with a soft tone, and only after we have already done it. Afterward, it is their responsibility and choice to change. We need to inspire through example (action) and give advice (help) only when asked.\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

You are forced to do things mechanically without reasoning why. Today, the most famous doctrines developed in religion, health, and fitness. We will focus on the latter two for this article.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at diets, for example. The Keto diet is the one trending now. Just type Keto on YouTube or Google, and you'll be amazed. Keto is a handy tool for weight loss among thousands of people. Does this mean it is right for you?\r\n\r\nAnother example is CrossFit and HIIT. It is handy for shredding fat and building muscle for thousands of people. Again, do these statistics mean you should try it?\r\n\r\n**Trends are usually marketing.** You see only the success, not the failures. Makes sense? Why would someone market their failures? It would be stupid.\r\n\r\nEvery rule has its exception, even if it has a 1\u002F1.000.000 chance to occur. You may be that exception.\r\n\r\nEvery individual is unique. We all have different genes, different lifestyles, different environments. Thus, we cannot guarantee that a, for example, a diet is right for us.\r\n\r\nLet me give you another example. Is fish healthy? Damn, right it is. Studies have shown it; humans have been eating wild fish throughout their entire history. Everyone should eat fish, right? Wrong! There are thousands of people with a seafood allergy. Give them fish, and they might even die. Understand my point?\r\n\r\n**Our body has native inner wisdom.** It knows what it's best for it. What we should do is **always listen to our bodies**. There is a caveat, though. We need to understand our body's language. How so?\r\n\r\nWell, just because you crave potato chips doesn't mean you should eat them. They are not healthy. What your body is trying to make you aware of is that you are deficient in, let's say, sodium. Sodium is the primary ingredient in salt, which is the primary ingredient in potato chips. Understand the logic?\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that, although we are all different, we are also common in some way. We are all humans, aren't we? Some fundamentals apply to all of us. Thus, we should never follow dogmas, but rather **understand the basics and customize them to our uniqueness**.\r\n\r\nI've got sick and tired of misconceptions and confusions in health and fitness, so I bought books explaining the fundamentals of human anatomy, physiology, nutrition, and exercise. I have read them from cover to cover and developed a more significant understanding of how the human body functions.\r\n\r\nI invite you to do the same. Instead of letting yourself confused and fooled by dogmas, start reading, learning, and thinking. See the bigger picture in everything.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   we are all unique, and we should understand our uniqueness through our body's signals;\r\n-   we all have a lot in common (we are humans); hence, we should learn the basics and customize them according to our uniqueness (experiment).\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr\u003E\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Frankly, even small daily tasks like going to the gym and eating healthy seem to be impossible to reach for the majority of people.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, those people who cannot achieve small daily tasks are also failures in their own lives. The opposite is also true. There is no successful person who doesn't succeed in daily small basic tasks like working out, eating healthy, and going to bed on time.\r\n\r\n**How you do anything is how you do everything**.\r\n\r\nIt is the snowball effect. Small actions eventually turn into more significant actions. Little habits reflect on long habits.\r\n\r\n# Self-discipline\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, self-discipline is the strongest superpower a man can have. It is the one skill that made me succeed in life and become independent and self-employed.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the simple act of making my bed every morning, or washing the dishes after every meal has made the process of developing healthy habits and achieving goals much more comfortable for me.\r\n\r\nGod, I don't even think now! I do! I have become a person of action just by doing the simple uncomfortable things.\r\n\r\nThe reason why people fail to sustain long-term goals is that they also fail at maintaining small-term, daily goals. These people even wait for someone to push them when it is their job to push themselves.\r\n\r\nBelieve me; if you're self-disciplined, you won't need motivation. You'll act without (over)thinking.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't take me for granted. Experiment yourself.\r\nExample of small, disciplined habits:\r\n- grocery list;\r\n- monthly expenses;\r\n- making bed;\r\n- washing dishes after meals;\r\n- keep the clothes tidy in the closet;\r\n- crossing the street legally;\r\n- going to bed at the same hour;\r\n- phone on airplane mode during the night;\r\n- stairs instead of the elevator;\r\n- walking instead of driving;\r\n- water instead of soda;\r\n- fruit instead of candy;\r\n- start a workout routine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get comfortable being uncomfortable. **The root of all fears is pain**. If you get used to small daily amounts of pain or discomfort, it will disappear.\r\n\r\nYou will no longer procrastinate and do anything right away. Why? Procrastination is the delay of uncomfortable actions. It is the avoidance of pain. However, if you see (temporary) pain as something useful and harmful, you will no longer delay any task.

What a controversial and delicate subject. I could ask people on the street all day about _\"What is the secret to happiness?\"_ or _\"What is happiness?\"_ and I would get a different response all the time.\r\n\r\nYou see, happiness is misinterpreted. Contrary to popular belief, **happiness is not the destination, but the journey**. What do I mean by that?\r\n\r\nWe are used to saying: \"When I will... I will be happy\". Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nWe attach happiness to an achieved future goal. Thus, happiness is a destination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a vicious cycle. How many times have you achieved a certain goal, but you weren't as happy as you thought you'd be? All the time? This is because of acclimatization. We adapt to everything new.\r\n\r\nBy attaching happiness to something we don't have, we will never be satisfied with what we have.\r\n\r\nPlease don't misinterpret what I just wrote. I am not saying you should not make progress or focus on the next level, but to not attach happiness to it. This brings us to the first key to happiness.\r\n\r\n# Gratitude\r\n\r\nGratitude is always appreciating what you already have. Better, **always wanting what you already have**.\r\n\r\nImagine this: there is at least one person in the world who wishes - dreams - to having something you do. Let's take water or food, for instance: some people do not have or afford this necessity while you may have plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why poor people are often happier than wealthy people. They appreciate the basic and simple things in life. **Poor (village) people have fewer choices than wealthy (city) people.**\r\n\r\n# Self-acceptance\r\n\r\nPeople living in communities and small villages are more connected to themselves and nature. They are authentic. Living in the city and addicted to technology makes us, paradoxically, more connected and disconnected at the same time.\r\n\r\n**We have come to believe that we should be anyone other than ourselves, a typology. It is a sin to be different.**\r\n\r\nWe are all different and we need to embrace it. **Every one of us is a single unique manifestation of the Universe itself**. The Universe evolves through us. We should accept and embrace who we are, not curse, hide, or run from who we are.\r\n\r\nRemember, **you are all you have in this life** from the beginning to the end. **Love yourself first, because people and objects come and go.** What they leave behind is all that matters.\r\n  \r\n\u003E All our possessions are just borrowed.
