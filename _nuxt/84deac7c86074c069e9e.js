It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it. You are making me feel bad,\" then this is not how a man reacts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you can say is: \"Yeah! I am like a pig. Be a good girl and scratch my belly from time to time, won't you?\" and laugh about it. You can also say: \"I don't know. I kind of look sexy with this belly.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGot the idea? The idea is: **don't take her seriously**. Always be prepared to make a laugh of her complaints towards you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBe careful, though. There are times when you must take her seriously. If she tells you not to stop leaving your underwear on the floor, then you have to listen to her. In this case, you can make fun of yourself by smiling and saying: \"Oh man. My bad. I forgot to tell you that we have a pig in the house. I will go and put him back in his cage.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, you make fun of your mistakes, but still, you will keep in mind to improve. You also made each other laugh about the issue.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe point is, **don't be intimidated by her and don't make her your queen**. She is your woman, and you are her man.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nWe men are rational beings. We always try to find patterns and some sense in everything. Women, however, are emotional beings. They behave and act based on their current emotional state (mood).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring periods of pressure, blood flows differently in the brains of men and women. **In women, blood flows more in the limbic system,** the emotional brain**, whereas in men, blood flows more in the prefrontal cortex,** the part of the brain involved in decision making and problem-solving. [[1]](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071119170133.htm)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt makes sense now why **during stress, women make no sense**. The part of the brain involved in emotions overrides the part of the brain involved in rationality. Women are overwhelmed by their feelings, and that is why we, as men, need to be emotionally stable. We need to be there for them and support them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext time she complaints about something or over-reacts, understand that it is not her fault. If her mood is changing, realize that it is her natural dynamic. Don't take it personally as if it is your fault. Be a man for your woman, because that is what she wants.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   women are hard-wired to seek financial, emotional, mental, and physical security, so, they will look for these features in a man;\r\n-   women want their men to be strong mentally, emotionally, and physically, so, they will test them and try to make them stronger;\r\n-   women are emotional beings (limbic system-oriented), whereas men are rational beings (prefrontal cortex-oriented).
