Tasks like exercising, cooking, shopping, laundry, etc. are now automatic and don't require any mental energy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, whatever you need to do, focus only on the first step. If you need to study, just set the goal to sit down and open the book. If you need to do your homework, focus on sitting at your desk, and doing one exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can also look at it like this: **you know you will do it sometime, so why avoid the inevitable?**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in school, I liked to do my homework on Friday, because then I knew my entire weekend would be free and be relaxed.
