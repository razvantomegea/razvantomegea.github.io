This article and blog are purely educational and informational._\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live dark times, that's for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntil the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.\r\n\r\n# Fresh air\r\n\r\nWe need fresh air to purify ourselves. **We live most of our lives in boxes**: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe some of you don't have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, **open the damn windows** and let the air come in. Don't incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStaying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day**. If I don't, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.\r\n\r\n# Vitamin D3\r\n\r\nAnother reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don't get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVitamin d3 is **essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin** (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don't agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check [Dr. Mercola's website](https://vitamind.mercola.com/).\r\n\r\n# (Less) Hygiene\r\n\r\nDisinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That's what they keep on saying everywhere we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHippocrates said: \"Everything in excess is opposed to nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is also a saying: \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExcess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they **disrupt our microbiome.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria** within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, **antibacterial does not mean antiviral**, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, our **microbiome is essential in developing antibodies**. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is enough to **use regular soap** to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check [this](https://en.unesco.org/news/how-soap-kills-covid-19-hands) and [this](https://www.uchealth.org/today/why-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus/)). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYour body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you're tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.\r\n\r\n# Healthy food\r\n\r\nWe are what we eat, that's for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won't grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you make your diet based on **vegetables and fruits**. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you're not vegan or vegetarian, **lean meats** are great. If you tolerate **eggs and fish,** Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nSleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExercise **increases blood flow and oxygenation**, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.\r\n\r\n# Stress management\r\n\r\n(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because **chronic stress lowers our immune system**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFind ways to relax as much as you can. For me, **exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep** do miracles.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nForce yourself to **smile and be optimistic**. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n# Cold showers\r\n\r\nI have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. **I feel warm all the time** because my circulation is improved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. **Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.\r\n\r\n# Medicinal mushrooms\r\n\r\nNo, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest **medicinal mushrooms may** [**improve immunity**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520706/)**, may have** [**antioxidant properties**](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6995766) **and may** [**fight cancer**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504783/)**.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe most popular medicinal mushroom is **Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)**. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.\r\n\r\n# Turmeric and Ginger\r\n\r\nTurmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ginger), and [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGinger and turmeric may have **anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**, which in turn boost the immune system. Again, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any herb and supplement.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it! I hope you enjoyed it and be sure to share it with your friends and stay tuned for upcoming quality posts. Take care!",html:'<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and do not recommend any supplements and pharmaceuticals. This article and blog are purely educational and informational.</em></p>\n<p>We live dark times, that\'s for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.</p>\n<p>Our only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.</p>\n<p>Frankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.</p>\n<p>Until the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.</p>\n<h1>Fresh air</h1>\n<p>We need fresh air to purify ourselves. <strong>We live most of our lives in boxes</strong>: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?</p>\n<p>Maybe some of you don\'t have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, <strong>open the damn windows</strong> and let the air come in. Don\'t incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.</p>\n<p>Staying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?</p>\n<p><strong>I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day</strong>. If I don\'t, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.</p>\n<h1>Vitamin D3</h1>\n<p>Another reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don\'t get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.</p>\n<p>Vitamin d3 is <strong>essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin</strong> (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don\'t agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.</p>\n<p>If you don\'t have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check <a href="https://vitamind.mercola.com/">Dr. Mercola\'s website</a>.</p>\n<h1>(Less) Hygiene</h1>\n<p>Disinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That\'s what they keep on saying everywhere we go.</p>\n<p>Hippocrates said: &quot;Everything in excess is opposed to nature.&quot;</p>\n<p>Who was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?</p>\n<p>There is also a saying: &quot;Less is more.&quot;</p>\n<p>Excess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they <strong>disrupt our microbiome.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria</strong> within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.</p>\n<p>When sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, <strong>antibacterial does not mean antiviral</strong>, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.</p>\n<p>Among other benefits, our <strong>microbiome is essential in developing antibodies</strong>. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.</p>\n<p>When I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.</p>\n<p>It is enough to <strong>use regular soap</strong> to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check <a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/how-soap-kills-covid-19-hands">this</a> and <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/why-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus/">this</a>). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.</p>\n<h1>Sleep</h1>\n<p>Sleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Make sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep.

I told him I never felt a loved and desired child and that he never did anything for me. It stroke him through the heart. He couldn’t believe what I just said.\r\n\r\nA little background, my parents divorced when I was 10, and my father raised me on his own. After a few years, he married another woman, and they formed a new family. I felt pushed away ever since.\r\n\r\nMy father was always cold and difficult to deal with. He never told me he loved me or hugged me or anything. My mother had drinking problems, and they both were more focused on their issues than on me.\r\n\r\nI associated this without being loved, but now that I heard my father’s story, and now that I write my thoughts, I realize how childish and egotistical of me.\r\n\r\nMy father was always beaten by his father, and his parents also never showed him they loved him. He also went into the army at 14 years old and made his own life from scratch. Life made him cold and unable to express his feelings as a defense mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was raised by an abusive father and in a family with issues and violence. She was weak, and because my father is how he is, she felt unloved by both her husband and her father.\r\n\r\nI judged my parents for so many years and blamed them for me being so sensitive and unconfident. It turned out it is not their fault. They had the same and even worse childhood like I did.\r\n\r\nThere are so many children raised in a hell of a family, and they turn out tougher and less frustrated than me.\r\n\r\nYou see, I learned a lesson from which you can benefit as well:\r\n\r\n> Never judge a person before you put yourself into her shoes. You are most probably no better than she is.\r\n\r\nI realized my parents did what they could to make me the person I am today. I have no right to judge them. I need to take full responsibility for my life, stop the victim mentality, and live my life at full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is my fault from now on that my life is how it is. My past is past, and it is what it is. We cannot change our parents and family. We receive them for a reason, and we need to accept them as they are.

Unfortunately, few of us succeed in achieving their goals. Frankly, even small daily tasks like going to the gym and eating healthy seem to be impossible to reach for the majority of people.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, those people who cannot achieve small daily tasks are also failures in their own lives. The opposite is also true. There is no successful person who doesn't succeed in daily small basic tasks like working out, eating healthy, and going to bed on time.\r\n\r\n**How you do anything is how you do everything**.\r\n\r\nIt is the snowball effect. Small actions eventually turn into more significant actions. Little habits reflect on long habits.\r\n\r\n# Self-discipline\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, self-discipline is the strongest superpower a man can have. It is the one skill that made me succeed in life and become independent and self-employed.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the simple act of making my bed every morning, or washing the dishes after every meal has made the process of developing healthy habits and achieving goals much more comfortable for me.\r\n\r\nGod, I don't even think now! I do! I have become a person of action just by doing the simple uncomfortable things.\r\n\r\nThe reason why people fail to sustain long-term goals is that they also fail at maintaining small-term, daily goals. These people even wait for someone to push them when it is their job to push themselves.\r\n\r\nBelieve me; if you're self-disciplined, you won't need motivation. You'll act without (over)thinking.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't take me for granted. Experiment yourself.\r\nExample of small, disciplined habits:\r\n- grocery list;\r\n- monthly expenses;\r\n- making bed;\r\n- washing dishes after meals;\r\n- keep the clothes tidy in the closet;\r\n- crossing the street legally;\r\n- going to bed at the same hour;\r\n- phone on airplane mode during the night;\r\n- stairs instead of the elevator;\r\n- walking instead of driving;\r\n- water instead of soda;\r\n- fruit instead of candy;\r\n- start a workout routine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get comfortable being uncomfortable. **The root of all fears is pain**. If you get used to small daily amounts of pain or discomfort, it will disappear.\r\n\r\nYou will no longer procrastinate and do anything right away. Why? Procrastination is the delay of uncomfortable actions. It is the avoidance of pain. However, if you see (temporary) pain as something useful and harmful, you will no longer delay any task. You will achieve anything in no time. Just try!\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it! I hope you enjoyed it and be sure to share it with your friends and stay tuned for upcoming quality posts.

So many opinions and so much confusion. If you are reading this, I guess you are struggling with getting lean and staying lean.\r\n\r\nI've been fluctuating with my weight and body composition throughout my life in a visible manner. I've been experimenting with some diets and eating patterns, and I've found that only one trick worked. It's not just me, but the majority of people. It's the **law of physics** that will never be broken.\r\n\r\nDoes it require discipline? Yes! Is it simple? Yes! Is it easy? In the beginning, not at all. In the beginning, nothing is easy, but if you want to be lean, then you will do it.\r\n\r\n# Calorie deficit\r\n\r\nThe calorie deficit is the holy grail of body composition. Body fat, adipose tissue, is stored energy. Energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, just transformed.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with calories, **calories are a unit of measurement for energy**. Our bodies require energy to function every day. We use energy when we think, when we digest, when our heart pumps blood, when our organs do their jobs. Nothing can be achieved without energy.\r\n\r\nWe get the **energy from the food we consume**. Every food has some energy. If it's packaged, the food has a label and you can see some nutrition facts on the label. The first one, bolded is energy.\r\n\r\n**If we ingest more energy than we burn, that energy will be stored in our body somewhere, so we will gain weight**. If we burn more than we ingest, that energy will be released and used. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion.\r\n\r\n# How many calories do we need?\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's pretty hard, nearly **impossible to estimate 100% accurately how much we ingest and burn** throughout that day. This is why so many people say calorie counting is useless. It is not useless. Don't be discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily about tracking 100% accurate. It is more about **being mindful of everything you put in your mouth**. Trust me, you can lose fat without moving a finger if you're tracing your calories properly.\r\n\r\nYou just need to be approximately around your calorie goals. In the last 7 years, the only thing that worked for me to be lean and stay lean is calorie count and being in a calorie deficit. Ask any professional fitness coach or nutritionist and they will tell you the same.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have some metabolic or hormonal disorder. In these cases, your metabolism is in chaos, and may be hard to estimate your resting metabolic rate. If this is the case, you'll have to experiment with some daily calories on a weekly basis and see how your body changes and then adjust from there. The calorie equation still applies.\r\n\r\nI recommend you **use an app** to do this job, otherwise, it is overkill. You can use my app, [https://lifestyletrack.web.app/](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/). You can track your body composition, diet, and exercise habits. It will do all the calculations for you.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing you need is to **calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR)**. This is the energy your body consumes when your sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, it is around 2000 kcal per day. This is why the professionals set 2000kcal as the average daily caloric requirements. It is not correct though. We are not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to **track your eating habits**. Everything that you eat and has calories, track it.\r\n\r\nLastly, track your **physical activities**. From housework to intense workouts.\r\n\r\nThe energy balance equation is this: **food - resting metabolic rate - physical activities**. Again, my application will do this for you.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lose fat, the energy balance equation must be **slightly less than 0 (max -10% of required)**. If you want to gain some healthy weight, the energy balance equation must be **slightly more than 0 (max +10% of required)**. For maintenance, **around 0**  **(+/-3% of required)**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   you need to track your calories if you want to change your body composition;\r\n-   if you want to lose fat, you need to be in a slight calorie deficit (10%);\r\n-   if you want to gain healthy weight, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus (10%);\r\n-   if you want to maintain, you need to be in calorie maintenance.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!

My grandmother keeps saying that because she has a small pension. Unfortunately for her and other people in my country, their pensions stay the same, but the costs increase year after year.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs a comparison, people with Ph.Ds and degrees in some domains have big pensions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, is a degree the absolute requirement for a good life? The answer is: it **depends on your personality and goals**. How come?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn my country, there are a lot of people with only maybe eight classes and have expensive cars and huge houses. They didn't even go to high school but have more money than a Ph.D.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI also learned from \"[Rich Dad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuifm5ns5SRG8LZJ6gCfKyw)\" that you don't need to go to school to make money because they don't teach money in school.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to make money, you don't need a college necessarily, but there is a catch: you need to be **self-disciplined and a risk-taker**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's be honest: it is much easier and safer to work as an employee; you have a stable and guaranteed monthly payment. Keep in mind, though, that **working as an employee is not that guaranteed** as you think. I know people who were very dedicated and respected at their workplace, and still lost their jobs because the company needed to cut back on expenses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is what happened this year because of the pandemic. Millions of people lost their jobs, not because they did something wrong, but because business began to fail. I lost colleagues because the company lost a client and had to cut down expenses, and I fear that it cand happen to me someday.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live in days in which it is more important how you look than who you are or what you do.

Question everything, and do your research.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's see some common myths in health and fitness that are wrong.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Cholesterol in eggs is bad\r\n\r\nEggs yolks contain cholesterol, and high blood cholesterol damages the heart. Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCholesterol is **required to help the body synthesize vitamin D and testosterone.** Cholesterol may come from food or can be synthesized by the liver.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because we eat something, high cholesterol doesn't mean we will have high blood cholesterol. There are people with low cholesterol diets that have high triglycerides because they eat a lot of sugar. Also, having **high total blood cholesterol is not bad.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat we call blood cholesterol are lipoproteins of different densities and triglycerides. If you ever did a blood cholesterol test, you probably saw: LDL (and VLDL), HDL, triglycerides, and total lipids. From these numbers, **all that matters is the HDL ratio to the rest of the lipids**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe higher the HDL and the lower the LDL + triglycerides, the healthier you are. Total blood cholesterol is irrelevant. [My app](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/) will help you with cholesterol tracking and numbering.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen we consume good quality eggs with the yolk, both our HDL and LDL may rise in harmony. Eggs also have amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. They are the perfect food unless you have an allergy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, check Dr. Joseph Mercola's and Chris Kresser's articles ([this](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKm1it8M9nlsjkhKEVN3T8tq2lwVxTh-4yIpIQftbyHkAKS6MekYGz9KnZOG1qLkH7NW7ozbHbqnXRgnr3pp9z4gUfgNddtLMPnRkixnAfvE0zhkhqel8feSfxoXAuPMTx1NNViz1J757oZCm5br8Qw-mAky4h7VxtMgNSu77JSS&guccounter=2), [this](https://chriskresser.com/three-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away/), and [this](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/cholesterol-levels.htm)).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Spot reduction\r\n\r\nDo crunches, and you'll lose belly fat. Do squats or lunges, and you'll lose fat from the legs. Unfortunately, we cannot force our bodies to burn fat from where we want. **The place we accumulate body fat is dictated by our genes and by our hormones**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only way to **lose body fat from all the places is through a** [**calorie (energy) deficit**](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/do-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Eating at night makes you fat.\r\n\r\nDon't eat after six o'clock, that's what they say. Wrong!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter when you eat. If your goal is to lose body fat, your only focus should be low calories and high satiety (high protein, fiber, and water). When you eat or how you spread your meals is your choice. If you are always full and in a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat without even trying.\r\n\r\n# Myth: 8 hours of sleep at night\r\n\r\nHow much sleep we need is **dictated by our age, gender, lifestyle, and genetics**. We are not the same, and general recommendations will never work. Some people can are fresh in 6 hours, other in 10.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMore important than sleep quantity is sleep quality. If you sleep 6 hours and are ready to move mountains, you're good to go. **Always listen to your body**, not to medical professionals. [My app](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/) will help you track your sleep and tell you about your sleep quality.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fast-food makes you fat.\r\n\r\n**No food makes you fat as well as no food makes you lose fat**. If you're eating only from fast-food but are in a calorie deficit, you'll lose fat. Also, if you eat only non-processed, non-GMO, organic, Saint, purified, energized, heavenly food but are in a calorie surplus, you'll gain fat. It is Isaac Newton science.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Alcohol makes you fat\r\n\r\nAlcohol can make you fat if you are eating afterward or while drinking. **Alcohol dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, the satiety and hunger hormones, and causes you to eat more.** If you also drink beer, which has a lot of calories, you'll gain fat for sure if you're in a calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to drink, do not overdo it, choose low-calorie drinks, and eat only before. I drink at a maximum of 1 bottle of dry wine per week, if not per month.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fruit makes you fat because of fructose\r\n\r\nIt is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. How can you say watermelon, which has 30kcal per 100g, makes you fat. I ate this summer 1kg of watermelon per day and lost body fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like how Greg Doucette said: \"I am sure people are overweight and obese because they are eating to much fruit.\" It still makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain and for the last time, **excess calories and only calories make you gain body fat**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   egg yolks are healthy, and you can eat as much as you like, as long as you don't abuse (3-5/day is ok);\r\n-   genetics and hormones dictate where you store fat;\r\n-   genetics, age, gender, and lifestyle dictate how much sleep you need;\r\n-   alcohol makes you fat indirectly by making you eat more;\r\n-   no food and drink cause weight loss or weight gain directly, only calories.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n***Want more Q&As or myths debunked?

Losing fat is all about being in an [energy deficit](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/do-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI know that during a year when I stopped tracking my calories and eat only healthy food, I gained 10 kg. **Eating for health and longevity is not equal to eating for fat loss**. It is why there is so much garbage fitness food out there that I am also consuming, like artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other chemicals. Yes, because being 100% healthy and 100% fit is not achievable for me at the same time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; there is garbage food everywhere. Everything is polluted and filled with chemicals and preservatives.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of so-called health foods that are calorie-dense (high calories per 100g). Let's see some common ones.\r\n\r\n# Cheese\r\n\r\nEverybody loves cheese, even people with lactose intolerance. I love cheese, but we need to learn to love what is good for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are many kinds of cheese, and I am not talking about low-fat cottage cheese, a great low-calorie, high-protein food. I am talking about the full-fat cheese, like cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick, and other matured high fat cheese.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey are very healthy and delicious, as they contain beneficial bacteria (if from trusted sources). The issue is they have **300-400 kcal per 100g. It is a lot of calories**, compared to low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, which contain 70-80 kcal per 100g.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I can never eat 50-100g of whole cheese. I eat 200-300g, which is 1000kcal. Thus, I avoid it and stick to low-fat dairy.\r\n\r\n# Coconut oil\r\n\r\nI used to put coconut oil in almost anything for its miracle benefits. They say it contains a lot of MCT oil, which is used directly for energy and not stored as fat. I was a fool to believe it. Any oil is stored as fat if it leads to a daily calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, coconut oil is a better alternative to plant-seed oils as it doesn't oxidize so quickly and easily. However, you still need to pay attention to the quantities, as it is **900kcal per 100g** (100% fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRegardless if you're using coconut oil or any oil, use a spray. I spray my pan when frying anything. Don't just pour from the bottle. If you don't have a cooking spray, use a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n# Peanut/Almond/Cashew butter\r\n\r\nI was addicted to peanut butter, and since the day I quit eating it, I started losing fat without thinking about it. **Peanut butter has, indeed, 26g of protein per 100g and lots of minerals, but it comes with a price of 550 kcal - if 100% peanuts**. There are kinds of peanut butter with only 50% peanuts, and the rest is palm oil. Those may reach 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found that a better version of peanut butter is powdered peanut butter, which is half the calories and doubles the protein.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI quit consuming peanuts completely, however, because I noticed I have smelly gas after, and I think I don't tolerate them (the irony).\r\n\r\n# Nuts and Seeds\r\n\r\nYou know what they say, eat vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds for a healthy diet. I agree only with 40% of this recommendation. The only healthy foods on this planet that anyone can agree with are vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGrains, nuts, and seeds are **high in calories and high in antinutrients** (prevent nutrient absorption.)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like to drink beer and eat nuts and seeds along the side, no wonder you have a big belly. **Nuts and seeds have ~650kcal per 100g**. 100g of nuts and seeds is less than a handful.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to snack something when watching a movie or when socializing, **choose home-made (not microwaved) popcorn or popcorn without added fat**. It has only 350kcal per 100g, but 100g is a lot.\r\n\r\n# Granola and Muesli\r\n\r\nMy journey to eating healthy begun with eating muesli, which is cereal combined with dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. If you also add some milk, you can have 1000kcal in a single meal. Now, if I think about it, granola is not that healthy, as it may contain a lot of sugar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy breakfast on muesli and milk had 1500kcal and didn't keep me so full, as it is mainly carbs and sugar. When we eat a **meal high in carbs and sugar (and fat), with low fiber and protein, we get an insulin spike and then a crash** (like Bitcoin in 2017). After the crash, we are hungry again.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Grains (pasta is from grains), dried fruits, sugar, and honey usually have 350kcal per 100g**. If you add the nuts and seeds, 100g granola (or muesli) can have 450 kcal per 100g, with minimal protein and fiber.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA better option is oatmeal with fruits and low fat cottage cheese or yogurt. Oatmeal, like bread, popcorn, or rice cakes, is expanded cereal, which adds more volume and fewer calories (~35% fewer calories.)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   choose low-fat foods if losing body fat is your goal;\r\n-   use oil and butter carefully, with a spray or teaspoon;\r\n-   avoid nuts and seeds;\r\n-   choose expanded grains (bread, popcorn, oatmeal, rice cakes) instead of ready to eat grains (granola, muesli, cornflakes, .etc.).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!

In this article, I will try to make you understand how human beings are meant to live and eliminate all possible confusions that dogmas have brought upon us.\r\n\r\nLet's forget everything we know for a second and have an overall picture of who and what we are.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we are mammals, and for millions of years, we have been living in the wild. In the last centuries, we have been more disconnected from our true nature than ever: living indoors, moving insufficiently, eating factory food products, sleeping out of sync and poorly, living inside our heads (overthinking/overstressing).\r\n\r\nAll other living beings except humans live in nature where they were destined to live. **Nature separation is where we have gone wrong.**\r\n\r\nIf we are meant to live in nature, we have to accept whatever and whenever nature has to offer.\r\n\r\nBut do we need?\r\n\r\n# Food\r\nWe need natural food. Food that is found almost ready to eat in nature and unaltered by man. We also need to keep in mind seasons and climate.\r\n\r\nWe are not herbivores, like elephants or giraffes, because we don't have big multi-chamber stomachs. We are also not carnivores (predators), because we don't have huge claws and teeth like tigers. We are something in between - **hunter-gatherers.**\r\n\r\nWe need to eat fresh vegetables and fruits (and some nuts and seeds from the shell) in seasons. The rest of the time, we need to hunt wild animals.\r\n\r\nWe also don't eat to eat all the time, because food may not be available all the time. Thus, **intermittent-fasting** may be in order as it is a natural thing to do, especially for consuming our stored energy (body fat).\r\n\r\nPracticality: **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting.**\r\n\r\n# Water\r\nNaturally (in the wild), we would drink only fresh spring water; hence, we should try to find the most unaltered water out there. Compared to regular tap water, spring water contains lots of minerals, and it is slightly alkaline.\r\n\r\nOf course, springs are not at every step, but we can there is **spring bottled water** in the markets. Just keep your eyes open for scams. Many bottles of water contain tap water.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more guaranteed, you can buy a water filter. The best one is the **reverse osmosis filter**. Other filters may also be fine if you are not living in polluted cities like New York.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **drink fresh spring water or purified water.**\r\n\r\n# Movement\r\nHunter-gatherers hunt and gather, which means spending most of the day on foot walking and carrying heavy things. Also, we need to ensure shelter which mens some hard labor. In some critical cases, we may also need to run to save our lives from predators.\r\n\r\nWe are meant to do **low-impact physical activity most of the day, mainly walking, and high-impact physical activity from time to time**.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\nAs wild animals, our circadian rhythms have been guided by the sun, and still is. Unfortunately, electricity (artificial light) has been messing up with our biological clock, and we no longer get the good quality sleep we once had.\r\n\r\nYou see, **sleep quantity is not that important**. Really! Have you ever heard people telling you they slept 6 hours, but still feel refreshed? Or, on the other side, have you ever heard people sleeping for 12 hours and always be tired?\r\n\r\nThe reason is the sleep quality.  The better the quality, the better the effect of sleep has on our body, like healing and assimilation.\r\n\r\nHow to achieve good quality sleep?

I entered this world three years ago, and I lost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore we begin with my investing mistakes, let's understand what investing is. In the simplest terms, investing is saving money and making them work for you. The money you invest is called capital.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can read more about investing basics on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp) as it exceeds the scope of this article. I also recommend reading \"The Richest Man In Babylon,\" \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\" and \"The Intelligent Investor.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my investing journey, I made the mistakes the books above tell not to do. Hence, I lost about $5000. It may sound a little to some people, but for me, it is a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI learned after so money years that I wasn't investing but gambling because I didn't know what I was doing, which brings me to my worst mistake.\r\n\r\n# Not Knowing What You're Investing In\r\n\r\nIf you're buying stocks, commodities, forex, crypto, or any other market just by analyzing a chart or by following the herd, you're not investing but gambling. You're better off betting in sports or playing in a casino.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy biggest mistake was not reading and informing myself enough. The biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffet, reads 8 hours per day about finance and the economy. When he invests, he knows for sure his investment will grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're investing, for example, in Amazon stock, don't just blindly invest because you herd Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet (or was before he divorced) or because it is in the top 10 companies in the world. It is not necessarily a good investment now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRead, read, read, and read again.\r\n\r\n# I Want Profit Now\r\n\r\nAnother mistake I made was wanting to make a lot of profit as soon as possible. It is truly a fairytale and a one in a million situations unless you have such a large capital that you invest in crypto at the right moment and a big spike happens like in 2017.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recently realized that investing is making a reasonable profit in more than five years. It applies to start-ups too; don't expect a large income in months, only in years or even decades.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want more money now, ask for a raise or get a better job.\r\n\r\n# Getting Emotional On Volatility\r\n\r\nI don't know if you've ever seen a market trend, but it is not smoothly going up or down. Trends have ups and downs that it is why trend moving averages are useful to determine the long term trend.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI made the mistake of exiting a bullish (up) long term trend because it became bearish (down) for the short term. It is ok to change directions from time to time. The intelligent investor buys when down trends happen after reversals because the market riched a new low.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nInvesting is buying a book worth $10 for $9 or less. If you see something of high value that a low price at the moment, then it is an opportunity to invest and wait. Always look at the big picture and don't be moved by periods of volatility.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, stay informed, as we can't guarantee that the change in direction is not the next long-term direction. For instance, Warren Buffet sold bank and airline stocks due to the pandemic which cause a global lockdown and economic crisis.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you think the trend is at its highest, sell if the market is about to reverse and enter again only if the market rebounds.\r\n\r\n# Ignoring The Leverage\r\n\r\nLeverage is a tool the allows an investor to multiply his investment by a given ratio.

It may sound like a fairytale, but it is possible in the world of investing. I entered this world three years ago, and I lost a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Before we begin with my investing mistakes, let's understand what investing is. In the simplest terms, investing is saving money and making them work for you. The money you invest is called capital.</p>\n<p>You can read more about investing basics on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp\">Investopedia</a> as it exceeds the scope of this article. I also recommend reading &quot;The Richest Man In Babylon,&quot; &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad,&quot; and &quot;The Intelligent Investor.&quot;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of my investing journey, I made the mistakes the books above tell not to do. Hence, I lost about $5000. It may sound a little to some people, but for me, it is a lot of money.</p>\n<p>I learned after so money years that I wasn't investing but gambling because I didn't know what I was doing, which brings me to my worst mistake.</p>\n<h1>Not Knowing What You're Investing In</h1>\n<p>If you're buying stocks, commodities, forex, crypto, or any other market just by analyzing a chart or by following the herd, you're not investing but gambling. You're better off betting in sports or playing in a casino.</p>\n<p>My biggest mistake was not reading and informing myself enough. The biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffet, reads 8 hours per day about finance and the economy. When he invests, he knows for sure his investment will grow.</p>\n<p>If you're investing, for example, in Amazon stock, don't just blindly invest because you herd Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet (or was before he divorced) or because it is in the top 10 companies in the world. It is not necessarily a good investment now.</p>\n<p>Read, read, read, and read again.</p>\n<h1>I Want Profit Now</h1>\n<p>Another mistake I made was wanting to make a lot of profit as soon as possible. It is truly a fairytale and a one in a million situations unless you have such a large capital that you invest in crypto at the right moment and a big spike happens like in 2017.</p>\n<p>I recently realized that investing is making a reasonable profit in more than five years. It applies to start-ups too; don't expect a large income in months, only in years or even decades.</p>\n<p>If you want more money now, ask for a raise or get a better job.</p>\n<h1>Getting Emotional On Volatility</h1>\n<p>I don't know if you've ever seen a market trend, but it is not smoothly going up or down. Trends have ups and downs that it is why trend moving averages are useful to determine the long term trend.</p>\n<p>I made the mistake of exiting a bullish (up) long term trend because it became bearish (down) for the short term. It is ok to change directions from time to time. The intelligent investor buys when down trends happen after reversals because the market riched a new low.</p>\n<p>Investing is buying a book worth $10 for $9 or less. If you see something of high value that a low price at the moment, then it is an opportunity to invest and wait. Always look at the big picture and don't be moved by periods of volatility.</p>\n<p>However, stay informed, as we can't guarantee that the change in direction is not the next long-term direction. For instance, Warren Buffet sold bank and airline stocks due to the pandemic which cause a global lockdown and economic crisis.</p>\n<p>When you think the trend is at its highest, sell if the market is about to reverse and enter again only if the market rebounds.</p>\n<h1>Ignoring The Leverage</h1>\n<p>Leverage is a tool the allows an investor to multiply his investment by a given ratio.

After I do some work, I prepare my first main meal, usually around 11:00 a.m. The **whey protein shake, creatine, greens powder, vitamin D3, medicinal mushrooms (for immunity) are the only supplements I take.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy first main meal is usually an **omelet** (five eggs and six egg whites), two cans of **grilled mackerel in water**, three slices of **toast bread**, some **tomatoes**, some **red peppers**, some **greek yogurt**, some **fruit**, and some **green tea**. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe second meal is usually around 5:00 p.m., and I will have **some lean meat with vegetables**. It can be grilled **chicken breast**, baked **sweet potatoes**, and some **salad** in some days. On other days, it can be some grilled **beef** with **potatoes** and salad. Sometimes I will make a **stew** with lots of vegetables and lean meat. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter this meal, I will eat some **fruit**, depending on the season. It can be watermelon, peaches, nectarines, blackberries, apples, cherries, clementines, etc. This snack is around 300kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like consistency. **I enjoy eating the same foods**, my favorite foods, over and over again. It requires less mental energy. I never have cheat meals because I don't need them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are days and periods I am away from home, or I hang out with my friends, girlfriend, or (and) family. When this happens, I focus on my favorite food groups: vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. If these are not present, I eat small portions of something similar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI drink alcohol on occasions, but only when I have a day off from everything the next day, usually on Saturday or Friday. When I drink, I choose low-calorie drinks, like wine, cognac, or \"rachiu\" (a beverage from Romania similar to tequila, but better).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI try to avoid, when not at home, fried foods, fatty foods, and deserts. These are high in calories, low in volume, and highly palatable. They make me eat them without stopping.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy strategy is to **eat foods high in volume, rich in water, fiber, and protein, and low in calories**. It is the reason why I eat vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. These foods fill me up with the least amount of calories. They also offer me all the essential nutrients I need: amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't keep in my house trigger foods, foods that I like so much that I cannot stop eating them after I begin. For me, these foods are peanut butter and coconut, or foods containing them. I like them so much that I cannot stop myself at a bite.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be as lean as possible. Of course, I want to increase my muscle mass as well, but I don't think I have the genetics to be a monster. To achieve my goal, I stay in a constant calorie deficit or maintenance at a maximum and eat sufficient protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My daily requirements are ~3000kcal, and I eat ~2500kcal.** Some days I burn less and eat less. It depends. I also aim to consume **200g protein per day,** to build and preserve my muscle mass, and 100g fats. I don't care how much carbs I consume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **eat only foods you enjoy and avoid trigger foods, but make sure they are high in volume and low in calories.**\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nI love walking. I **walk everyday 6-15km**. During these sessions, I burn 350-900kcal. It is an exercise I can do regardless of the weather, with any equipment, anywhere, any time. It also helps me relax, makes me feel better, and sleep better.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am also a fan of strength training. **I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and train all the muscle groups in one session**. For a while, I went to the gym six days per week, using the push-pull-legs split, but it was too exhausting, and I didn't have the Saturday off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe full-body training split ensures I equally train all the muscle groups, and I have a rest day between sessions for my muscles and nervous system to recover. I also have the weekends off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **do the exercises you enjoy and which you can stick to** regardless of external circumstances.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is so underrated these days. We cannot make wise decisions and function at our full potential without good quality sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sleep, it is not much to say. I **fall asleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 08:00 a.m.** every day. Sometimes, on weekends, I go to bed later and wake up later, but not every weekend. Whenever I can, I stick to my sleeping schedule, and I aim **towards 8-9 hours of sleep per night.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have some habits before bed, though. **After 10:30 p.m. (1 hour before sleep), all lights are turned off** and avoid them. Artificial lights make me alert and disrupt my melatonin (sleep hormone) levels. Maybe it happens to you too. I also **keep the room dark as a cave and not too warm.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn my phone and laptop, I use the Iris app to filter out blue light, which hurts my eyes and disrupts my sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed that chamomile tea before bed helps me sleep a lot better, so I drink 2-4 cups before bed. When I don't have tea, I take a sleep supplement with valerian root, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d3, and melatonin. I don't recommend any supplements to anyone; I am just informing what I do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours** so that the body sets its circadian rhythm. Also, avoid any form of artificial light 1 hour before bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat is all my friends. The big lesson you need to take from this article is to **create a routine for life that you enjoy.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I eat foods high in volume and low in calories (vegetables, fruit, and lean meats), that I enjoy, and avoid foods that I can't stop eating;\r\n-   I walk every day and train my entire body three times per week;\r\n-   I go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours, and avoid artificial light one hour before bed;\r\n-   one day per week, I don't stick to my routines and enjoy life with my loved ones.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!

Muscles grow very slow if you have been training for a long time and don't have rare genetics. Thus, I choose to look fit like an athlete at the expense of not looking so big.\r\n\r\n# Strength training 3x per week\r\n\r\nI do a full-body strength training three times per week. You may think this is for beginners, but it is not. The legendary bodybuilder Reg Park and Steve Reeves (and other old-school bodybuilders) were fans of this style of training. They were big, lean, and natural.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI did for a while upper-lower slipt and push-pull-legs split, but this is the one I enjoy doing the most. **When I do multiple exercises per muscle group in a single session, I feel I can't push at the maximum at each muscle group exercise.** It makes sense if you train as hard as you can at the first exercise, you then exhaust the muscle and won't give it your all at the following.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy legs are the biggest victims. After I do heavy squats or Bulgarian split squats, I can't walk; my legs are shaking. I would be exhausted if I were to do 2-3 leg exercises in one session.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI think if you train correctly and intensely, you need less time in the gym. The muscle needs stimulus to grow, not destruction. Your **muscles don't grow in the gym, but during recovery**, if you provide them all nutrients.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnother important point I want to make is I focus on **compound movements, using only bodyweight, free weight, and pulley** based exercises. I feel they engage me the most and have a functional implication on the body.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at my workouts, shall we?\r\n\r\n## Workout #1 Monday:\r\n\r\n-   Bench press;\r\n-   Weighed pull-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Arnold press;\r\n-   Lying triceps extensions;\r\n-   E-Z Bar barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #2 Wednesday:\r\n\r\n-   Incline dumbbell press;\r\n-   Barbell rows;\r\n-   Military press;\r\n-   Rope triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Dumbbell curls;\r\n-   Bulgarian split squats;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n## Workout #3 Friday:\r\n\r\n-   Weighed dips;\r\n-   Weighed chin-ups;\r\n-   Squats;\r\n-   Lateral raises + rear delts superset;\r\n-   Triceps pushdowns;\r\n-   Barbell curls;\r\n-   Hanging toe toches;\r\n-   Brisk walking on an incline.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the big muscle group exercises, I do **one warm-up set of 10-15 reps, and four working sets of 3-6 reps with the same weight**. When I can do six reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the small muscle group exercises, I do **four working sets of 5-8 reps**. When I can do eight reps on all four working sets, I put more weight.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne important note: I have **2-minute breaks between sets**, I **don't cheat**, and I **focus**  **on slow eccentric (negative)**. I do a 1-2 second concentric, 1-second isometric, and 3-4 second eccentric. The negative movement of the exercise has a higher impact on muscle growth than the positive one (check out [this](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/why-you-should-lift-and-lower-heavy-things/)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, my workout routine allows me to recover between sessions. **When doing a high-intensity workout, your muscles are not the only ones exhausted, but your nervous system as well**. The nervous system doesn't have time to recover if one is doing a heavy high-intensity workout on consecutive days.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't do direct exercise on calves, forearms, and traps because they are worked indirectly by the compound movements.\r\n\r\n# Walking\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the days, I like to take long walks. Walking has no demand on the nervous system and even **helps with recovery**; not to mention that it **burns a lot of calories**. If you walk 12km, which is about 15.000 steps, you burn 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe best thing about walking is that you can do it anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I do full-body workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday;\r\n-   I do only compound movements;\r\n-   I do five sets for the big muscle group exercises, and four sets for the small ones;\r\n-   I focus on slow negatives (3-4 seconds) and correct form;\r\n-   I take 2-minute breaks between sets;\r\n-   I take long walks (12-15km) in the days off.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***",html:"<p>I am not as developed as other guys, but, unfortunately, I am fitter than 50% of the population.

Regardless of your goals, you need to have a healthy, balanced diet.\r\n\r\nWant to build muscle? More calories (10%) and protein.\r\nWant to burn fat? Fewer calories (10%) and intermittent fasting.\r\nWant to be healthy? Eat natural, unprocessed food.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to restrict carbs or fat or anything. Just eat real food as natural and minimally processed as possible. This implies a lot of home preparation and cooking.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to drink lots of water. 3L per day is optimal. If you also live in a hot climate or it is summer, 5L is optimal.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nThe body needs to recover. The body is broken down and stressed out in the gym. It is during sleep when the muscle cells are rebuilt and when our healing hormones are secreted.\r\n\r\nA regular sleep schedule is the hardest thing to do in this century.

What you need is correct exercise execution and constant progress, a nutritious and balanced diet, and good quality sleep. That's it!\r\n\r\nAfter you've maintained a routine for at least a year, then you can start investing in supplements.\r\n\r\nWhat most fitness addicts recommend is:\r\n\r\n-   whey isolate protein (or pea + hemp protein mix if you're a vegan);\r\n-   l-glutamine;\r\n-   creatine monohydrate;\r\n-   l-carnitine;\r\n-   organic vitamins and minerals complex;\r\n-   krill oil;\r\n-   for lazy days, a pre-workout (citrulline malate, beta-alanine, caffeine).\r\n\r\nAny other supplement is not worth the hype.\r\n\r\n# Patience\r\n\r\nLower your expectations. Don't expect to see significant results in just a month. If you would like to be like Dwayne Johnson, keep in mind that he has been having a healthy and disciplined lifestyle (exercise, diet, sleep) for 10+ years.

Welcome to the blog. I hope you are doing well. In this article, you will discover the lowest risk asset in the stock market, which has always returned profit throughout the decades.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is for educational purposes only. I am not recommending you to buy any assets. You choose what you do with your money. I am not a broker or a financial expert. I am just sharing an investment asset that has returned profits for more than a century.\r\n\r\nThis investment is also Warren Buffet’s (the best investor) [best recommendation for non-professionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GrKhUdu-YE). I don’t know about you, but I am listening when he suggests an investment.\r\n\r\n## S&P 500\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is the safest and simplest investment in the stock market. No investing knowledge and time consumption required.

experience that trading is bullshit. Why? Because of these two laws of the stock market.\r\n\r\nTrading relies on technical analysis to predict the market. 90% of traders who rely on technical analysis lose money, according to  [Bill Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNxt298VVOw&list=PLp9LyEgIX9p8UqlZnVAcKnOeRwSxOM6B6).\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Wolf Of Wallstreet? The character played by Matthew McConaughey said:\r\n\r\n> “No one can predict if the stock market is going up, down, sideways, or in frickin circles.”\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the 10% traders who makes profit long term, good for you. For me and the other 90% of traders doesn’t work. So what should we do instead? We should cleverly invest long-term.\r\n\r\nWe should research in advance of any investment initially. Afterward, we must buy and hold for at least 3–5 years. We must also periodically analyze each investment to be sure it is still a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhy hold for years? Here’s why:\r\n\r\n# 1. The stock market will always crash\r\n\r\nWe have seen through time that recessions occur. It is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Unfortunately, we can never predict when a stock market will crash.\r\n\r\nJust look at the stock and real estate market now during the pandemic. The government prints trillions of dollars and euros, unemployment is going up, money does no longer circulate because people stay at home, but the stock and real market are going up.\r\n\r\nCheck this video from Ray Dalio on  [How the economy works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s). He explains how the economy works and why we are in a new great depression.\r\n\r\nRecessions occur every few decades that cause the stock market to crash and come back only after 3–5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the reason for holding for at least 3–5 years. In case of a crash, the market will have time to bounce back, and you won’t be at a loss.\r\n\r\n# 2. The market will always come back\r\n\r\nThe S&P, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have always crashed but always came back stronger than ever. By the way, check my article on the  [S&P 500](https://medium.com/the-capital/the-lowest-risk-time-proof-investment-everyone-should-choose-d22d5c9cfe56).\r\n\r\nIf we look at the historical charts of good stocks and indexes, they always had periods of lows, but then came back higher than ever. We need to accepts that crashes and bubbles are commonalities of the stock market.\r\n\r\nEven the crypto markets have periods of going up, crashing, then coming back stronger than ever. For crypto, these periods come every four years during halvings. It means 2021 is a bull run for crypto, but this is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is to stop listening to experts who say to buy now, sell now, go short, go long, or whatever. Now you know that you can’t predict asset movements based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can predict if an asset goes up long term based on scientific research. What you can’t predict is short temporary moves based on technical analysis.\r\n\r\n# How to apply this knowledge?\r\n\r\n1.  Research an asset to find if it has the potential to grow;\r\n2.  Buy and asset if not overvalued. Don’t emotionally buy because of fear of missing out based on hype (FOMO). For instance, don’t buy Tesla now;\r\n3.  During market crashes, buy more, don’t sell. You can use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to periodically buy small amounts than to buy high amounts at once;\r\n4.

That is 50% of the world's population. Every year, the number increases by 300.000 people. The reason for switching from old fashioned phones to smartphones is mobile apps.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe love apps because they make our lives easier and more pleasant. Someone has to create these apps, though. These guys are software developers like me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am a web developer, and I make web apps. Web apps are cool because they are independent of the operating system and device. If you have a browser (and you do), you can run it on your PC, phone, and tablet.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWeb apps are not very good at handling heavy computational stuff. They are a lite version of native apps for iOS, Andriod, and other OS. Native means the app requires download and installation on your device.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor instance, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Medium, Shopify, and others are all web apps. The regular person sees them as websites, but they are web apps because they have logic and dynamic data in the back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, the majority of them have native mobile apps besides the web versions because of performance reasons.

No one has the time or likes to wait, especially on smartphones.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGoogle recommends the page load time on the phone to be < 3 seconds.

I have no person in my family who is truly happy, nor a friend. My friends and I are young and still a work in progress, but even so, something is missing. We never seem to get enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor a while, I used to be happy with my life. Then I met people. In my shell, I saw only the beauty of life: I was healthy, and I had enough money to take care of myself. I was alone, though, but I didn't care.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSomething happened, and I realized I couldn't live alone anymore. Life without relationships around is an empty life. I started going out and reconnecting with people and, at the same time, gently lost confidence in myself.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI never understood why I lost my self-confidence and why I am still struggling to be as confident as possible. After digging within, searching for an answer, I found something interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow come I have everything a man wants in life, and everything achieved by myself, but still no confidence? Because I don't realize who I am and how much I have achieved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI realized I was comparing myself with others. I thought other people are higher than me and more successful, and I thought I was not enough and not doing enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I am not other people. I am me, and I have my path. I need to accept myself as I am and live my own life as it is. I need to make my life heaven in my way. It applies to you and everyone around you.\r\n\r\n# Accept Who You Are\r\n\r\nAccept yourself as you are because you are unique and beautiful as you are. I don't mean to stop improving yourself. I mean, do what you can to achieve your goals and be happy with your achievements.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't make you genuinely happy, don't even think of trying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI see people unhappy because they spend too much time on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, and whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people traveling and exotic places and wish to be there instead of where they are now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see actors and singers with fancy close and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see expensive cars and houses and wish they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey see people with perfect bodies and faces and wished they had them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn other words, people hate their lives and want to escape through movies and social media. It makes me sad that social media and television manipulate us into working our lives for money and then spending on things we don't need and on which we never have the time to enjoy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe don't need all the crap they lie to us we need.

What a controversial and delicate subject. I could ask people on the street all day about _"What is the secret to happiness?"_ or _"What is happiness?"_ and I would get a different response all the time.\r\n\r\nYou see, happiness is misinterpreted. Contrary to popular belief, **happiness is not the destination, but the journey**. What do I mean by that?\r\n\r\nWe are used to saying: "When I will... I will be happy". Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nWe attach happiness to an achieved future goal. Thus, happiness is a destination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a vicious cycle. How many times have you achieved a certain goal, but you weren\'t as happy as you thought you\'d be? All the time? This is because of acclimatization. We adapt to everything new.\r\n\r\nBy attaching happiness to something we don\'t have, we will never be satisfied with what we have.\r\n\r\nPlease don\'t misinterpret what I just wrote. I am not saying you should not make progress or focus on the next level, but to not attach happiness to it. This brings us to the first key to happiness.\r\n\r\n# Gratitude\r\n\r\nGratitude is always appreciating what you already have. Better, **always wanting what you already have**.\r\n\r\nImagine this: there is at least one person in the world who wishes - dreams - to having something you do. Let\'s take water or food, for instance: some people do not have or afford this necessity while you may have plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why poor people are often happier than wealthy people. They appreciate the basic and simple things in life. **Poor (village) people have fewer choices than wealthy (city) people.**\r\n\r\n# Self-acceptance\r\n\r\nPeople living in communities and small villages are more connected to themselves and nature. They are authentic. Living in the city and addicted to technology makes us, paradoxically, more connected and disconnected at the same time.\r\n\r\n**We have come to believe that we should be anyone other than ourselves, a typology. It is a sin to be different.**\r\n\r\nWe are all different and we need to embrace it. **Every one of us is a single unique manifestation of the Universe itself**. The Universe evolves through us. We should accept and embrace who we are, not curse, hide, or run from who we are.\r\n\r\nRemember, **you are all you have in this life** from the beginning to the end. **Love yourself first, because people and objects come and go.** What they leave behind is all that matters.\r\n  \r\n> All our possessions are just borrowed.

Our times require this attitude to life to prevent us from being fooled.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write something on a rock before I die, it would be:  _“question everything.”_\r\n\r\nEvery few thousand years, Gods (or God) we believe in are scientifically proven to be unmythical, and then we create another God. This fact is enough for you to take into consideration my opinion about questioning.\r\n\r\nThere is a question, however, with which I am still struggling to answer.

It is independent of age, gender, race, lifestyle, and any demographic. It is the most profound connection a person could ever feel.\r\n\r\nThis connection may take a lifetime to establish, if not more. Not knowing yourself means living an empty (soulless) life without a sense of direction of what is good or bad. I know because I felt it.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little boy, I had the desire to create something that would help other people and myself. I wanted to be a hero in a way or another.

I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n#### 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n> Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n> Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n#### Short/Medium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short/medium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n#### Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n> There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n### The 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n> Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n> Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n#### Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n#### Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities.

Stay with me as our posts are always short and concise.\r\n\r\nThere are many magic pills spread around the web that guarantee easy and rapid fat loss. I am sorry for disappointing you, but if you are looking for the easy and fast solution, you are going to crash and burn.\r\n\r\n**Fat loss is all about human physiology.** If you understand the basics (like everything in life) you will no longer waste your time, money, and energy on useless crap.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the human body is an amazingly complex machine that is influenced by the environment, so it's impossible to track everything; we can't be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut let's focus on what we can control, okay?\r\n\r\n2 major factors impact fat loss:\r\n\r\n# Energy deficit\r\n\r\nOf course, I am talking about calories. This is the golden rule, you cannot eat anything as much as you can without getting fat, regardless of how healthy it is.\r\n\r\n# Hormones\r\n\r\nHormones are, basically, chemical messengers that help our cells communicate with each other. Hormones dictate our state, how we feel, okay? This includes hunger.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule for permanent and smart fat loss is a combination of the two factors above:\r\n\r\n**Maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.**\r\n\r\nMake sure you remember this: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.\r\n\r\nThis is where all diets fail. They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.\r\n\r\nThe secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.\r\n\r\nThese foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.\r\n\r\nI will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.\r\n\r\nFor fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.\r\n\r\nMovement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.\r\n\r\n**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**\r\n\r\nSleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep, our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.\r\n\r\nAlso, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or/and fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe ideal sleeping time is from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m., but we cannot all follow that schedule. Thus, I suggest going to bed and waking up every day at the same time and make sure you sleep 7-9 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can also try some of these [sleeping hacks](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/sleeping-hacks).\r\n\r\nNow we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?\r\n\r\nTo tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.\r\n\r\nInsulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.\r\n\r\nRemember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**\r\n\r\nThe question is now: when is insulin in the blood?\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.\r\n\r\nThere has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**\r\n\r\nThis is why diets low in carbohydrates (e.g. Keto) and intermittent fasting are so effective for fat loss. I prefer intermittent fasting as it is easier to maintain and it also offers many health benefits.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water. This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy.\r\n\r\nYou can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;\r\n - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;\r\n - **Stay active** throughout the day;\r\n - Have a **regular sleep schedule**, ideally from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m.;\r\n - Go **low carb** or try **intermittent fasting**.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [Do Calories Matter?

Muscle building is all about science.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Anatomy and Physiology\r\n**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.\r\nOnly one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**\r\n\r\nThere are three types of muscle fibers:\r\n- **Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\r\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\r\n\r\nThe size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).\r\n\r\nThe primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.\r\n\r\nThe **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:\r\n- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);\r\n- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);\r\n- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nATP replenishment times:\r\n- 20 sec - 50.00 %;\r\n- 40 sec - 75.00 %;\r\n- 1 min - 87.50 %;\r\n- 80 sec - 93.75 %;\r\n- 100 sec - 96.88 %;\r\n- 2 mins - 98.44 %;\r\n- 140 sec - 99.22 %;\r\n- 160 sec - 99.61 %;\r\n- 3 min - 99.81 %.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)\r\nThere are two types of hypertrophy:\r\n- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;\r\n- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\r\n\r\nSarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).\r\n\r\n**_Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time._**\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called **satellite cells** become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\nHormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:\r\n- **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);**\r\n- **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);**\r\n- **Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);**\r\n- **Growth hormone (GH);**\r\n- **Testosterone.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\r\n\r\n# Efficient, targeted strength training\r\nIf our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let's see:\r\n\r\n|Fiber type|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I|+15|70%|2 - 0 - 1|\r\n|Type IIA|6-12|75-85%|4 - 0 - 3|\r\n|Type IIB|1-3|+90%|3 - 1 - 1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nGeekier:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I sarcomere hypertrophy|15-50|<70%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|>50|<50%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy|6-15|70-85%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|12-25|50-70%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy|3-5|85-95%|3-1-1|\r\n|Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|6-12|70-85%|3-1-1|\r\n|Absolute strength|1-2|>90%|3-1-1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Sets|Reps per set|%1rep-max(1RM)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Maximum muscle size|3|6-12|75-85%|\r\n|Maximum strength|3-7|1-5|>85%|\r\n|Combined muscle and strength|3|3-12|75-90%|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBe careful to **perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.** Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.\r\n\r\n# Best strength training exercises\r\nThe best strength training exercises are unquestionably the **free weight compound movements:**\r\n- **Squats;**\r\n- **Deadlifts;**\r\n- **Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;**\r\n- **Parallel Dips;**\r\n- **Bent Over Rows**\r\n- **Pull-ups / Chin-Ups**\r\n- **Military Presses**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.\r\n\r\nConstantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.\r\n  \r\n# Training frequency\r\nThe muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must **train each muscle group 2-3 times per week**. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.\r\n\r\nFor busy people who don't have much time to spend in the gym, **three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough**. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.\r\n\r\nSmall-boned characteristics:\r\n- Wrist circumferences <10.5% of the height;\r\n- Ankle circumferences <13.0% of the height.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body's systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.\r\n\r\nIdeally, **a rest day should follow each training day.**\r\n\r\nMuscle fatigue is caused by:\r\n- Lactic acid accumulation;\r\n- ATP shortage;\r\n- PC shortage;\r\n- Inorganic phosphate accumulation;\r\n- Peripheral nervous system fatigue;\r\n- Central nervous system fatigue.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe **training session should be for 45-75 minutes**.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\nFor building muscle, we need **minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,** and **10% caloric surplus**. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.\r\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:\r\n- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);\r\n- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;\r\n- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);\r\n- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\r\n\r\n# Other lifestyle factors\r\nOf course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.\r\n\r\nSleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nMake sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.\r\n\r\n**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n- train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;\r\n- focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;\r\n- execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;\r\n- for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;\r\n- for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in >85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;\r\n- for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;\r\n- constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;\r\n- rest ~2 minutes between sets;\r\n- train for 45-75 minutes;\r\n- ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;\r\n- whole good quality food;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;\r\n- scheduled good quality sleep;\r\n- 2-6L water per day;\r\n- relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle1.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle2.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle3.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth1.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth2.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part I: Exercise Selection](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/selection.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/sequence.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/reps.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part IV: Training Frequency](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/frequency.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/split.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/rules.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](https://youtu.be/agUmfvM4rjw);\r\n - [The Truth About Rep Ranges & Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High](https://youtu.be/yLR9rfuE6Sg).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!

A motor neuron and its fibers are called a <strong>motor unit.</strong></p>\n<p>There are three types of muscle fibers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\n<p>The size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).</p>\n<p>The primary energy currency for all cells is <strong>Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mitochondria</strong> are responsible for producing ATP via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phosphagen system</strong> (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);</li>\n<li><strong>Anaerobic glycolysis</strong> (anaerobic);</li>\n<li><strong>Oxidative phosphorylation</strong> (aerobic) - Kreb\'s cycle and electron transport chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>ATP replenishment times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 sec - 50.00 %;</li>\n<li>40 sec - 75.00 %;</li>\n<li>1 min - 87.50 %;</li>\n<li>80 sec - 93.75 %;</li>\n<li>100 sec - 96.88 %;</li>\n<li>2 mins - 98.44 %;</li>\n<li>140 sec - 99.22 %;</li>\n<li>160 sec - 99.61 %;</li>\n<li>3 min - 99.81 %.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)</h1>\n<p>There are two types of hypertrophy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</strong>;</li>\n<li><strong>Sarcomere hypertrophy</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\n<p>Sarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called <strong>satellite cells</strong> become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.</p>\n<p>Hormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Growth hormone (GH);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Testosterone.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\n<h1>Efficient, targeted strength training</h1>\n<p>If our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let\'s see:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fiber type</th>\n<th>Rep range</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n<th>Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>70%</td>\n<td>2 - 0 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>75-85%</td>\n<td>4 - 0 - 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n<td>+90%</td>\n<td>3 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\nGeekier:\n<br>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Training goal</th>\n<th>Rep range</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n<th>Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>15-50</td>\n<td>&lt;70%</td>\n<td>2-0-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>&gt;50</td>\n<td>&lt;50%</td>\n<td>2-0-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>6-15</td>\n<td>70-85%</td>\n<td>4-0-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>12-25</td>\n<td>50-70%</td>\n<td>4-0-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>3-5</td>\n<td>85-95%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>70-85%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Absolute strength</td>\n<td>1-2</td>\n<td>&gt;90%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\nBriefly:\n<br>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Training goal</th>\n<th>Sets</th>\n<th>Reps per set</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum muscle size</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>75-85%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum strength</td>\n<td>3-7</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n<td>&gt;85%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Combined muscle and strength</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3-12</td>\n<td>75-90%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Be careful to <strong>perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.</strong> Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.</p>\n<h1>Best strength training exercises</h1>\n<p>The best strength training exercises are unquestionably the <strong>free weight compound movements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Squats;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Deadlifts;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Parallel Dips;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bent Over Rows</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pull-ups / Chin-Ups</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Military Presses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\n<p>Try to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.</p>\n<p>Constantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.</p>\n<h1>Training frequency</h1>\n<p>The muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must <strong>train each muscle group 2-3 times per week</strong>. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.</p>\n<p>For busy people who don\'t have much time to spend in the gym, <strong>three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough</strong>. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.</p>\n<p>Small-boned characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrist circumferences &lt;10.5% of the height;</li>\n<li>Ankle circumferences &lt;13.0% of the height.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\n<p>Keep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body\'s systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.</p>\n<p>Ideally, <strong>a rest day should follow each training day.</strong></p>\n<p>Muscle fatigue is caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lactic acid accumulation;</li>\n<li>ATP shortage;</li>\n<li>PC shortage;</li>\n<li>Inorganic phosphate accumulation;</li>\n<li>Peripheral nervous system fatigue;</li>\n<li>Central nervous system fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>The <strong>training session should be for 45-75 minutes</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Diet</h1>\n<p>For building muscle, we need <strong>minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,</strong> and <strong>10% caloric surplus</strong>. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) <strong>whole foods</strong> and not fitness supplements.\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good quality <strong>Complete protein powder</strong> (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);</li>\n<li><strong>Creatine monohydrate</strong> or complex;</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex</strong> (extracted from natural food sources);</li>\n<li><strong>Krill Oil</strong> (Omega-3s).</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\n<h1>Other lifestyle factors</h1>\n<p>Of course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. <strong>Sleep</strong> is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.</p>\n<p>Sleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between <strong>10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.</strong>, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to <strong>go to sleep and wake up at the same hours</strong> every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.</p>\n<p>Make sure to <strong>stay hydrated</strong>. We need <strong>2-6L of water per day</strong>, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic stress</strong> is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>This is what you should get from this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;</li>\n<li>focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;</li>\n<li>execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;</li>\n<li>for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;</li>\n<li>for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in &gt;85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;</li>\n<li>for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;</li>\n<li>constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;</li>\n<li>rest ~2 minutes between sets;</li>\n<li>train for 45-75 minutes;</li>\n<li>ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;</li>\n<li>whole good quality food;</li>\n<li>min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;</li>\n<li>min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;</li>\n<li>scheduled good quality sleep;</li>\n<li>2-6L water per day;</li>\n<li>relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Follow the white rabbit</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle1.html">The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle2.html">The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle3.html">The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth1.html">Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth2.html">Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/selection.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part I: Exercise Selection</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/sequence.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/reps.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/frequency.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part IV: Training Frequency</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/split.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/rules.html">The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="https://youtu.be/agUmfvM4rjw">The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="https://youtu.be/yLR9rfuE6Sg">The Truth About Rep Ranges &amp; Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There you have it!

Is it an exam, a project, or just the usual daily chores?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis delaying of duties is called procrastination. Funny enough, we are still procrastinating even though we know we still need to do it in the future. How can this happen? How can we fool ourselves in avoiding the inevitable?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is something deep down in our human nature.\r\n\r\n# Energy preservation\r\n\r\nFor millions of years, human beings have been fighting with survival. Food was not always at our disposal like today, and we didn't have the privilege to access anything at just one click distance.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack then, everything required our energy. Our energy was critical, and we needed to be careful with how we spent it. Thus, **we are programmed to preserve our energy** as much as possible.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccomplishing tasks requires both physical and mental energy. Our conservatory body, especially our brain, is fighting to avoid any energy waste. It is why we find it so hard to put ourselves to work. **Our body has programmed us to be lazy.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are tricks to fool our brains into doing the work.\r\n\r\n# Focus on the first step\r\n\r\nUsually, when we try to convince ourselves to do tasks, **we think of the entire process at once**. If we have more than one thing to do, we think of all of them at once and try to calculate every step in our minds.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe process of analyzing every step in our minds becomes overwhelming. I don't know about you, but for me, it is stressful and makes me anxious.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I found is that **if I focus only on the first step, then everything flows on its own.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is always the hardest because it is the one step that makes us get into the zone.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhenever I want to write some code, and I don't feel like it, I trick myself by saying: \"I will just sit at the desk, open the programming tool and write one line of code.\" Hours pass by, and one line becomes 100 lines.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther tasks that were hard for me in the past now have become routines that I do on autopilot. Tasks like exercising, cooking, shopping, laundry, etc. are now automatic and don't require any mental energy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, whatever you need to do, focus only on the first step. If you need to study, just set the goal to sit down and open the book. If you need to do your homework, focus on sitting at your desk, and doing one exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can also look at it like this: **you know you will do it sometime, so why avoid the inevitable?**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in school, I liked to do my homework on Friday, because then I knew my entire weekend would be free and be relaxed. On the other hand, if I let my work for the last moment, then my mind would be only there, and wouldn't have enjoyed my free time to the fullest.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou see, if you accept that **there is no escaping from what you need to do**, you will do it anyway. What you can do is enjoying the process and make it fun. If you have a lot of time to accomplish it, **start early, and set small goals every day**. For instance, in college, I started studying since the first week and set myself the goal to read one page per day.

We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.\r\n\r\n-   the economy is about to crash;\r\n-   people die and are sick all around the planet;\r\n-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;\r\n-   some of us are unemployed;\r\n-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.\r\n\r\n# 1. Health is the most critical asset\r\n\r\nI learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.\r\n\r\nIt is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.\r\n\r\nTake care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**\r\n\r\nWe are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. \r\n\r\nAll I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.\r\n\r\nOur immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.\r\n\r\nYou see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:\r\n\r\n-   avoid closed and public areas;\r\n-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;\r\n-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;\r\n-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;\r\n-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);\r\n-   limit alcohol and smoking;\r\n-   eat real food and limit processed food;\r\n-   drink plenty of water;\r\n-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);\r\n-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;\r\n-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.\r\n\r\n# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it\r\n\r\nThere was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.\r\n\r\n**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**\r\n\r\nMy advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.\r\n\r\n# 3. Be prepared for anything\r\n\r\nI am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.\r\n\r\n-   I invested in a minimal home gym;\r\n-   I take cold showers;\r\n-   I spend most time alone;\r\n-   I work remotely;\r\n-   I cook and prepare my food;\r\n-   I live a healthy lifestyle;\r\n-   I don't depend on my parents.\r\n\r\nI am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.\r\n\r\nLife is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.\r\n\r\n# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.\r\n\r\nWe need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.\r\n\r\nYou may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.\r\n\r\n**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**\r\n\r\nLife will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\n**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.\r\n\r\nNow, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.\r\n\r\n**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**\r\n\r\n# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true\r\n\r\nEverybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.\r\n\r\n**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**\r\n\r\nJust ask, \"why?\". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.\r\n\r\n**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.\r\n\r\nReporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.\r\n\r\n**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!

It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it.

It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n## Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n## No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n## Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n## Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n## Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.

The primary reason is that people have become too self-centered and mean to each other. Few people do something for others out of self-interest.\r\n\r\nThere are good people out there, but they are lost in the crowd. They concluded that it is a waste of time to be the right person in a world of selfishness, meanness, crime, robbery, etc. Is it now?\r\n\r\n# The Hard And Right Way\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that evil is the easy road. As you can see, anybody can do it. Being kind, on the other hand, is the hard path and the right path as well. Being kind, you emit love while consuming hate and pain. Being unkind, you emit hate and pain while consuming love from other people.\r\n\r\nWe need to be the change we want to see in the world. If we want the world to be a better place, we need to be better.\r\n\r\n# Karma and Reincarnation\r\n\r\nI believe in karma and the afterlife. You see, have you ever wondered why children are born with diseases or in poverty or without parents? I don't believe in bad luck or chance. The Universe has a purpose and a way of ordering things that we don't understand.\r\n\r\nYou see, the entire Universe is made of energy, including us; that's a fact. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. When we die, our energy is reused in the Universe for further forms of life or matter. The process of energy reuse is what reincarnation is all about.\r\n\r\nThere is also the idea that we go to heaven or hell, depending on the kind of people we were. I believe heaven and hell are just oxymorons for further lives. What do I mean by this? You see, we gain and put energy into the Universe through our words, actions, thoughts, and emotions. All that energy will turnaround in the next life.\r\n\r\nEverything we think, feel, and do is invested in the Universe. The Universe learns and evolves based on every individual's actions. It is like a machine learning algorithm. Every next epoch (life) is based on the previous epoch in order to learn what it is meant to learn.\r\n\r\n# The Bigger Picture\r\n\r\nBeing the right person is an investment; you struggle now, but will be happy and fulfilled later. Being the wrong person is exactly the opposite.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am hallucinating, or it is too Sci-Fy what I just discussed here, but for me, these ideas make me see the bigger picture. These ideas help me combine science and religion as they both indicate the same direction, but with different paths (words).\r\n\r\nI believe our sensory systems and perceptions are inputs through which the Universe (God) sees itself. The Universe learns through you and changes based on your thoughts and emotions - as within, so without.\r\n\r\nEvery living organism is a manifestation of the Universe, through which the Universe perceives itself from different points of view. We are all connected to the same source of consciousness. We are one.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway is: **think, feel, and act like someone is always watching you because it is - you are - and treat every living organism like you would treat yourself because it is - we are one source of consciousness.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n> There you have it!
