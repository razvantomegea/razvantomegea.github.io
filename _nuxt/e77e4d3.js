This article and blog are purely educational and informational._\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live dark times, that's for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntil the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.\r\n\r\n# Fresh air\r\n\r\nWe need fresh air to purify ourselves. **We live most of our lives in boxes**: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe some of you don't have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, **open the damn windows** and let the air come in. Don't incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStaying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day**. If I don't, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.\r\n\r\n# Vitamin D3\r\n\r\nAnother reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don't get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVitamin d3 is **essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin** (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don't agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check [Dr. Mercola's website](https://vitamind.mercola.com/).\r\n\r\n# (Less) Hygiene\r\n\r\nDisinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That's what they keep on saying everywhere we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHippocrates said: \"Everything in excess is opposed to nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is also a saying: \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExcess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they **disrupt our microbiome.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria** within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, **antibacterial does not mean antiviral**, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, our **microbiome is essential in developing antibodies**. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is enough to **use regular soap** to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check [this](https://en.unesco.org/news/how-soap-kills-covid-19-hands) and [this](https://www.uchealth.org/today/why-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus/)). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYour body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you're tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.\r\n\r\n# Healthy food\r\n\r\nWe are what we eat, that's for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won't grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you make your diet based on **vegetables and fruits**. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you're not vegan or vegetarian, **lean meats** are great. If you tolerate **eggs and fish,** Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nSleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExercise **increases blood flow and oxygenation**, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.\r\n\r\n# Stress management\r\n\r\n(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because **chronic stress lowers our immune system**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFind ways to relax as much as you can. For me, **exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep** do miracles.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nForce yourself to **smile and be optimistic**. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n# Cold showers\r\n\r\nI have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. **I feel warm all the time** because my circulation is improved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. **Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.\r\n\r\n# Medicinal mushrooms\r\n\r\nNo, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest **medicinal mushrooms may** [**improve immunity**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520706/)**, may have** [**antioxidant properties**](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6995766) **and may** [**fight cancer**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504783/)**.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe most popular medicinal mushroom is **Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)**. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.\r\n\r\n# Turmeric and Ginger\r\n\r\nTurmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ginger), and [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGinger and turmeric may have **anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**, which in turn boost the immune system. Again, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any herb and supplement.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",html:'<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and do not recommend any supplements and pharmaceuticals.

I took the courses from  [XTB](https://www.xtb.com/en/learn-to-trade/trading-academy)  and got familiar with charts, patterns, and indicators.\r\n\r\nThus, I started trading in the demo account and made some profits, so I deposited money in a real account and started taking action. Everything went fine until I started losing money; lots of money.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why can’t I make easy money as others do? Fuck trading! It is all a scheme.” That was my attitude towards trading until I realized my mistakes and started making profits.\r\n\r\n**These lessons cost me $5000 plus $1000 lost in Bitcoin**, but I am sharing them with you for free, you lucky you. Ok, let’s see my mistakes.\r\n\r\n# Overexposed\r\n\r\nI  **traded with the money I was not comfortable with losing**. All my monthly savings were put into trading and it became like an addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter losing money I put money again with the hope I can compensate for my losses. Sound like gambling to me, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI was constantly checking the trading app, very stressed and panic when seeing everything in red. I didn’t know what I was doing. This leads us to my second mistake.\r\n\r\n# No strategy & research\r\n\r\nMy strategy was to make money, that’s it. I never implemented a backtested strategy for all 3 possible scenarios of a trend (up, down, sideways). If the candle was green buy; otherwise sell. Cool right?\r\n\r\nWell, lucky for you I have a good article on a simple, yet a profitable backtested strategy that you can apply on any market.\r\n\r\nBefore trading or investing, have a plan and make sure you understand what you are putting your money into.  **Technical analysis (trading) without fundamental analysis is bullshit**  in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple and I will give you Bitcoin as an example. All the charts and indicators indicate strong buy, but the bull market cycle is over or Elon Musk makes another tweet. The indicators are useless in this case.\r\n\r\nAnother example is buying Tesla just because the trend is going up and the oscillators say not overbought, but not considering the P/E ratio of 800 (extremely overpriced).\r\n\r\n# Not diversified enough\r\n\r\nYou know that saying:  **“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”**. I didn’t know that and put too much money into a single deal which was also not a well-researched deal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule of thumb for diversification, but you can for sure over diversify. The main idea is to  **choose different markets**  (stocks, commodities, real estate, crypto, etc.) and  **buy different assets.**\r\n\r\nNow, the way I do it is by looking at the cycles and fundamental indicators. For instance, I am more invested in crypto and commodities, than stocks and real estate.\r\n\r\nThis is because I know hyperinflation is coming, I know we are in a crypto bull market, and I know real estate and stocks are overpriced. Again, I am not just a trader, but also an investor (technical & fundamental analysis).\r\n\r\nAlso, in crypto, I choose only the best from the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, and not buying tens of crypto assets. I did that and it is a wrong approach.\r\n\r\nOk, hope everything makes sense. Let’ move to the next big mistake I made.\r\n\r\n# Over-leveraged\r\n\r\nI used  [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp)  without understanding it fully. The problem with leverage is that in case the market moves in the opposite direction, you are at risk of liquidation. Not only that but not using a stop loss… haha… awful shit can happen as it did to me.\r\n\r\nLeverage is the reason I lost so much money (for me, an average mortal).  **Leverage amplified my lack of knowledge, strategy, experience, and diversification.**\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what leverage is, let me explain it simply like this:  **your investment (or %price move) multiplied by a ratio**. In other words, if a market has a leverage of 1:2 (2x), that means you are doubling the price change.\r\n\r\nIf the price goes up 5%, the leverage amplifies and you are winning a 10%. Same story if the price goes down. You are borrowing money for investing. $100 invested in a 1:2 leveraged asset, is equal to $200 invested.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is, if you are a beginner or don’t understand how to use leverage, do not ever use it. The risk is not worth it.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nThe last mistake, but not the least is I let my emotions control my trading and investing decisions. Of course, no strategy, over-invested, not diversified, leverage, all these amplified my emotions.\r\n\r\n**Investing and trading must be 100% analytical**; with no emotions and gut feelings. If you can automate your trading strategy, it is awesome. Otherwise, know your plan and stick to it no matter what.\r\n\r\nRemember that  **no indicator, strategy, analysis, whatever are 100% guaranteed**  to offer you profits. It is a delusion most beginners like me had.\r\n\r\nWe are working with probabilities, and the idea is to increase the likelihood of ending up in profit.\r\n\r\n> A backtested strategy, with the right amount of investment, with enough diversification, without the risk of being liquidated, with patience, and no emotions will make you an unstoppable investor and trader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

However, they are wrong when they say gold, stocks, or cash have intrinsic value.\n\n# History of money\n\nIn the beginning, we used  **bartering**  as a form of transacting value —  **a medium of exchange**. People traded  **a cow for two sheep,**  for example.

Thus, the buyer and seller may negotiate and agree that a cow is worth two or three sheep. Makes sense?\n\nOver time, people evolved and started using some  **common currency**  to have a more stable and standard valuation of goods and services.\n\nIt makes sense because a person may say that a cow is more valuable than a horse, while another person may say the exact contrary. People needed a  **standard value estimation — store of value**. Hence, people started minting gold coins.\n\n**People chose gold**  as a store of value because of its nature: it  **doesn’t oxidate,** it can be **modeled into weighed coins,** and  it is **scarce**. Gold has stood the test of time as the standard value — the gold standard — mostly because people agreed upon it.\n\nFor sure, there are other earthly elements with similar anti-oxidative properties and scarcity, but people agreed to gold. It is a  **convention given by people**, not by universal laws. I hope it makes sense.\n\nOver time people started putting their gold into safe deposits and received a  **paper that proved their deposited wealth**. People used those papers for transactions instead of physical gold, which was also harder to transport.\n\nThe gold deposits were the first banks. Over time, banks started giving  **papers for the same gold deposit**  when people wanted to borrow gold because people never withdrew their gold. They  **relied on the paper proof**  of gold and not the gold itself.\n\nIt is how the case monetary system came into existence. People came into agreement that the number printed on the paper is the actual value.\n\nFor decades, the paper money of a country was the equivalent of gold it possessed. All until president Richard Nixon exited from his gold standard in 1978. Since then,  **governments could print money as much as they wanted**.\n\nNote: I tried to describe the history of money as briefly as possible and may have skipped some details.

The story with stocks is a bit different. Stocks represent fractional ownership of a public company, according to  [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp).\n\nYou may think a stock price goes up because the company’s profit goes up. We saw during the pandemic that  **although companies’ profits went down, stocks went up**.\n\nThe Buffet Indicator confirms that the stock market prices have detached from the current state of the economy.\n\nThe stock market — and other markets — went up because people started gambling on RobinHood, eToro, and other online brokerages during the pandemic.\n\nHow come people had money to invest during the pandemic? Because they could not travel, could not hang out, and stayed at home. The pandemic prevented people from spending, thus, reorienting them to online investing.\n\nSo, why does do markets go up on exchanges? Because people buy. It is the hard truth. When a  **lot of money goes into a stock, the stock goes up and vice versa.**  It is what happened with AMC and GameStop as well.\n\nAll of this means  **hype can create the illusion of value**. If most people agree Tesla has value and buy its stock, the stock will go up, and it did. It had a P/E ratio (Price relative to Earnings) of almost 1000. Extremely overpriced.\n\n# Crypto hype is history repeating\n\nThe crypto hype is the new hype of the online and informational revolution. At the beginning of the century — and millennium — we had the internet hype — Dotcom bubble. In 1720, we had the South Sea bubble. Now, we have the Crypto bubble.\n\nYes, it is a bubbl**e because the market is new, prices spike quickly, and people become very greedy**. A new market is easy to manipulate through social media and online news (e.g., pump and dump or fud).\n\nAs we saw,  **Elon Musk tweets Doge and the price goes up 1000 times**. Dogecoin — and other meme coins — are a joke (literally). However, if people believe they have value, they will have value.\n\nNow, there are companies and projects with some fundamentals behind the chart.\n\nFor instance, if GOOGL’s price goes down, by just knowing and understanding the company’s fundamentals, you can predict the price will come back in the future. Why? Because the  **company itself has value, not the stock.**\n\nHowever, if everybody decided Google has no value for some reason (e.g., it steals personal information, another company is better), the company will go to hell.\n\nThe same logic applies to all markets, including crypto. I choose to invest in  **Ethereum**  because of its potential to become (decentralized) Web 3.0. I also choose to invest in  **Bitcoin**  because I believe it is a better alternative to gold.\n\n# Blockchain technology is the future\n\nThere is a book called  **“The Bitcoin Standard”**  which describes the current flaws of our monetary system and why  **Bitcoin, among other things, is a good store of value**.\n\nBitcoin is not and will not be the only crypto out there. Many crypto projects, like Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana, have huge potential.\n\nThe name  **cryptocurrency is not intuitive**, in my opinion. Crypto assets or blockchain projects are a better naming because crypto is not just for finance but for other applications in our world.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nIn whatever asset, be it stock, commodity, or crypto, money goes, the price will follow, as well as money outside the asset. This process makes any publicly traded asset prone to manipulation.\n\nThis makes you understand the everything has no value until people believe in it and give it value.\n\nIf I ask for my house $100.000, but no one will offer me that price, my price is not worth $100.000. As long as there is a person willing to pay the price, the good or service has that asked price (value), otherwise, it doesn’t.\n\nDespite the fud and misconceptions about crypto, it is here to stay. People will slowly believe crypto has value and will incorporate it into their lives. They first need to understand the potential crypto has and the problems it solves.\n\n----------\n\n> Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

If you have been buying just because you saw the chart go up or because a friend told you to (like I did for a while), then you are not investing, but speculating.\r\n\r\nSpeculating is similar to gambling. You mindlessly put your money into some asset or bet and hope for the best. You mostly have a 50% chance of success, which is far from ideal.\r\n\r\nInvesting requires patient and careful research and there are tools out there that can ease the process. For your information, I am not sponsored by any of these companies. Let’s take a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n# CoinMarketCap\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for our crypto research journey is  [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). There we can find a lot of useful information about the overall crypto market and individual coins.\r\n\r\nCoin market cap (obviously), volume, supply, company or coin description, analysis, rating, news, exchanges, socials, etc.\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap is enough for anyone to better understand what they are putting their money into. You already know more than most speculators out there.\r\n\r\n# CoinToBuy\r\n\r\n[CoinToBuy](https://cointobuy.io/)  is very useful in analyzing crypto investment safety, potential profit, and hype. They calculate these values best on some ranking factors: volume, market cap, 24h change, social following, google trends, twitter citation, and user voting.\r\n\r\nBasically, all the ranking factors indicate short-term hype. The higher the hype, the higher the profit.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this tool however is that you cannot spot long-term crypto investments based on fundamental analysis, just short-term hype.\r\n\r\nThe tool is very useful for traders though, because the ranking is constantly changing.\r\n\r\n# IntoTheBlock\r\n\r\n[IntoTheBlock](https://app.intotheblock.com/)  is more technical than CoinMarketCap and requires a paid subscription. However, it provides a lot of detailed information about some coins. It is mostly used for token economics (tokenomics).\r\n\r\nCoinMarketCap has a tab called Analysis which offers a summary from IntoTheBlock, but it is not very clear. You need to get a deep dive.\r\n\r\nFinancial, ownership, network, exchanges, social, derivatives, and short-term price predictions are the feature we can find on this platform. It is quite interesting.\r\n\r\n# Crypto Rating Council\r\n\r\nHere you can see if your favorite crypto is considered a security or not. Have you heard about the Ripple lawsuit? Ripple’s XRP was considered security and not a currency. Hence, XRP has the highest score of all on  [CRC](https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/asset-ratings).\r\n\r\nMany crypto assets are close to being considered securities and this may negatively impact future prices. CRC is a good place to track those assets.\r\n\r\n# Blockchaincenter\r\n\r\nHere we can find two very useful tools:  [altcoin season index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)  and  [bitcoin rainbow chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/). These tools are very useful in timing Bitcoin and altcoin investments.\r\n\r\nEvery market goes in cycles, even bitcoin, and altcoins. The bitcoin cycle theoretically lasts four years (e.g. 2009, 2013, 2017, 2021, etc.), two bullish years, and two bearish years. Bitcoin’s halving date dictates the crypto cycles.\r\n\r\n# Look into bitcoin\r\n\r\n[LookIntoBitcoin](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/)  offers very useful charts that tell you if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. You should buy when undervalued, and sell when overvalued. Don’t FOMO.\r\n\r\n# Binance Research\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have the patience to read the project’s whitepaper like I do, you can search the project on  [Binance Research](https://research.binance.com/).\r\n\r\nHere you can find “institutional-grade analysis, in-depth insights, and unbiased information to all participants in the digital asset industry,”, as they present. Indeed, here you find everything you need to know about a project.\r\n\r\n# How I use these tools?\r\n\r\n1.  I make sure Bitcoin is not overvalued by checking the  [Bitcoin Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/),  [Pi Cycle Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/), and  [Bitcoin Investor Tool](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-investor-tool/). Bitcoin is the main driver of the bullish or bearish crypto market;\r\n2.  I choose crypto assets in the top 25 on CoinMarketCap;\r\n3.  I make sure I understand and like what problem the technology behind is trying to solve, reading the Overview on CoinMarketCap or their whitepaper;\r\n4.  I make sure the asset is not overvalued or overbought;\r\n5.  I make sure it has good ratings on the Ratings tab on CoinMarketCap;\r\n6.  I make sure the Safety Rank is higher than 4 in CoinToBuy;\r\n7.  I make sure the active addresses are going up;\r\n8.  I make sure there are less than 75% whales;\r\n9.  I make sure the asset is on Binance;\r\n10.  I make sure the asset is not a security;\r\n11.  (optional, but powerful) I dollar cost average into the asset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

If you are reading this, I guess you are struggling with getting lean and staying lean.\r\n\r\nI've been fluctuating with my weight and body composition throughout my life in a visible manner. I've been experimenting with some diets and eating patterns, and I've found that only one trick worked. It's not just me, but the majority of people. It's the **law of physics** that will never be broken.\r\n\r\nDoes it require discipline? Yes! Is it simple? Yes! Is it easy? In the beginning, not at all. In the beginning, nothing is easy, but if you want to be lean, then you will do it.\r\n\r\n# Calorie deficit\r\n\r\nThe calorie deficit is the holy grail of body composition. Body fat, adipose tissue, is stored energy. Energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, just transformed.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with calories, **calories are a unit of measurement for energy**. Our bodies require energy to function every day. We use energy when we think, when we digest, when our heart pumps blood, when our organs do their jobs. Nothing can be achieved without energy.\r\n\r\nWe get the **energy from the food we consume**. Every food has some energy. If it's packaged, the food has a label and you can see some nutrition facts on the label. The first one, bolded is energy.\r\n\r\n**If we ingest more energy than we burn, that energy will be stored in our body somewhere, so we will gain weight**. If we burn more than we ingest, that energy will be released and used. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion.\r\n\r\n# How many calories do we need?\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's pretty hard, nearly **impossible to estimate 100% accurately how much we ingest and burn** throughout that day. This is why so many people say calorie counting is useless. It is not useless. Don't be discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily about tracking 100% accurate. It is more about **being mindful of everything you put in your mouth**. Trust me, you can lose fat without moving a finger if you're tracing your calories properly.\r\n\r\nYou just need to be approximately around your calorie goals. In the last 7 years, the only thing that worked for me to be lean and stay lean is calorie count and being in a calorie deficit. Ask any professional fitness coach or nutritionist and they will tell you the same.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have some metabolic or hormonal disorder. In these cases, your metabolism is in chaos, and may be hard to estimate your resting metabolic rate. If this is the case, you'll have to experiment with some daily calories on a weekly basis and see how your body changes and then adjust from there. The calorie equation still applies.\r\n\r\nI recommend you **use an app** to do this job, otherwise, it is overkill. You can use my app, [https://lifestyletrack.web.app/](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/). You can track your body composition, diet, and exercise habits. It will do all the calculations for you.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing you need is to **calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR)**. This is the energy your body consumes when your sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, it is around 2000 kcal per day. This is why the professionals set 2000kcal as the average daily caloric requirements. It is not correct though. We are not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to **track your eating habits**. Everything that you eat and has calories, track it.\r\n\r\nLastly, track your **physical activities**. From housework to intense workouts.\r\n\r\nThe energy balance equation is this: **food - resting metabolic rate - physical activities**. Again, my application will do this for you.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lose fat, the energy balance equation must be **slightly less than 0 (max -10% of required)**. If you want to gain some healthy weight, the energy balance equation must be **slightly more than 0 (max +10% of required)**. For maintenance, **around 0**  **(+/-3% of required)**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   you need to track your calories if you want to change your body composition;\r\n-   if you want to lose fat, you need to be in a slight calorie deficit (10%);\r\n-   if you want to gain healthy weight, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus (10%);\r\n-   if you want to maintain, you need to be in calorie maintenance.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n",html:"<p>So much noise out there.

You may think that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates have enough money, but they don't. These guys are at another level. They no longer see money as we do - spending potential. They see money as capital for investments. It is how they made their fortune.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there you have it. If you want to increase your wealth, start investing. Easy, right? Surely not. Investing requires some **financial education, some capital, and lots of patience**. A lot of us don't have these qualities, but we can earn them.\r\n\r\n# Financial education\r\n\r\nFinancial education teaches us about money and how to earn it smartly. I recommend reading **\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\"** written by Robert Kiyosaki and **\"The Richest Man In Babylon,\"** written by George Clason**.** The biggest lesson I learned from these books is the value of making money work for you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, we are taught in school to work for money, but these books teach us to make money work for us. It is how top Forbes successful people did it and continue to do it. It is straightforward for them, but not for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou must be asking now: how can I make money work for me if I don't have any? Shouldn't I work for money first to earn them? It depends on your character. Many **successful investors invest money which isn't theirs**. You can do it too if you have the guts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor example, you can borrow money, invest, make some profit, payback, and reinvest your profit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOthers start their own business and then invest, but this is still the same concept: **make money work for you.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is to educate yourself on finances. Learn everything you can about how money works. You can start with the two books mentioned above and with \"The Rich Dad Channel\" on Youtube.\r\n\r\n# Personal finance management\r\n\r\nIt is the point of this article and the first step in making money: cash-flow. Where does your money go? Do you buy more liabilities (cars, clothes, parties) than assets (real estate, commodities, businesses)? Do you save money every month, or do you spend mindlessly?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTaking **control of your finances is the first step in making money** work for you. If every month you remain with 0 and you depend on the next salary, then you are not doing something right. You are consuming too much.

Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCholesterol is **required to help the body synthesize vitamin D and testosterone.** Cholesterol may come from food or can be synthesized by the liver.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJust because we eat something, high cholesterol doesn't mean we will have high blood cholesterol. There are people with low cholesterol diets that have high triglycerides because they eat a lot of sugar. Also, having **high total blood cholesterol is not bad.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat we call blood cholesterol are lipoproteins of different densities and triglycerides. If you ever did a blood cholesterol test, you probably saw: LDL (and VLDL), HDL, triglycerides, and total lipids. From these numbers, **all that matters is the HDL ratio to the rest of the lipids**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe higher the HDL and the lower the LDL + triglycerides, the healthier you are. Total blood cholesterol is irrelevant. [My app](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/) will help you with cholesterol tracking and numbering.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen we consume good quality eggs with the yolk, both our HDL and LDL may rise in harmony. Eggs also have amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. They are the perfect food unless you have an allergy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this topic, check Dr. Joseph Mercola's and Chris Kresser's articles ([this](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-cholesterol-myth-that_b_676817?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKm1it8M9nlsjkhKEVN3T8tq2lwVxTh-4yIpIQftbyHkAKS6MekYGz9KnZOG1qLkH7NW7ozbHbqnXRgnr3pp9z4gUfgNddtLMPnRkixnAfvE0zhkhqel8feSfxoXAuPMTx1NNViz1J757oZCm5br8Qw-mAky4h7VxtMgNSu77JSS&guccounter=2), [this](https://chriskresser.com/three-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away/), and [this](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/cholesterol-levels.htm)).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Spot reduction\r\n\r\nDo crunches, and you'll lose belly fat. Do squats or lunges, and you'll lose fat from the legs. Unfortunately, we cannot force our bodies to burn fat from where we want. **The place we accumulate body fat is dictated by our genes and by our hormones**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe only way to **lose body fat from all the places is through a** [**calorie (energy) deficit**](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/do-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n# Myth: Eating at night makes you fat.\r\n\r\nDon't eat after six o'clock, that's what they say. Wrong!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter when you eat. If your goal is to lose body fat, your only focus should be low calories and high satiety (high protein, fiber, and water). When you eat or how you spread your meals is your choice. If you are always full and in a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat without even trying.\r\n\r\n# Myth: 8 hours of sleep at night\r\n\r\nHow much sleep we need is **dictated by our age, gender, lifestyle, and genetics**. We are not the same, and general recommendations will never work. Some people can are fresh in 6 hours, other in 10.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMore important than sleep quantity is sleep quality. If you sleep 6 hours and are ready to move mountains, you're good to go. **Always listen to your body**, not to medical professionals. [My app](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/) will help you track your sleep and tell you about your sleep quality.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fast-food makes you fat.\r\n\r\n**No food makes you fat as well as no food makes you lose fat**. If you're eating only from fast-food but are in a calorie deficit, you'll lose fat. Also, if you eat only non-processed, non-GMO, organic, Saint, purified, energized, heavenly food but are in a calorie surplus, you'll gain fat. It is Isaac Newton science.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Alcohol makes you fat\r\n\r\nAlcohol can make you fat if you are eating afterward or while drinking. **Alcohol dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, the satiety and hunger hormones, and causes you to eat more.** If you also drink beer, which has a lot of calories, you'll gain fat for sure if you're in a calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to drink, do not overdo it, choose low-calorie drinks, and eat only before. I drink at a maximum of 1 bottle of dry wine per week, if not per month.\r\n\r\n# Myth: Fruit makes you fat because of fructose\r\n\r\nIt is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. How can you say watermelon, which has 30kcal per 100g, makes you fat. I ate this summer 1kg of watermelon per day and lost body fat.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like how Greg Doucette said: \"I am sure people are overweight and obese because they are eating to much fruit.\" It still makes me laugh.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain and for the last time, **excess calories and only calories make you gain body fat**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   egg yolks are healthy, and you can eat as much as you like, as long as you don't abuse (3-5/day is ok);\r\n-   genetics and hormones dictate where you store fat;\r\n-   genetics, age, gender, and lifestyle dictate how much sleep you need;\r\n-   alcohol makes you fat indirectly by making you eat more;\r\n-   no food and drink cause weight loss or weight gain directly, only calories.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n***Want more Q&As or myths debunked?

No, you can eat only from KFC and McDonald's and be fit; I don't recommend this, though. Losing fat is all about being in an [energy deficit](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/do-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI know that during a year when I stopped tracking my calories and eat only healthy food, I gained 10 kg. **Eating for health and longevity is not equal to eating for fat loss**. It is why there is so much garbage fitness food out there that I am also consuming, like artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other chemicals. Yes, because being 100% healthy and 100% fit is not achievable for me at the same time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; there is garbage food everywhere. Everything is polluted and filled with chemicals and preservatives.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of so-called health foods that are calorie-dense (high calories per 100g). Let's see some common ones.\r\n\r\n# Cheese\r\n\r\nEverybody loves cheese, even people with lactose intolerance. I love cheese, but we need to learn to love what is good for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are many kinds of cheese, and I am not talking about low-fat cottage cheese, a great low-calorie, high-protein food. I am talking about the full-fat cheese, like cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick, and other matured high fat cheese.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey are very healthy and delicious, as they contain beneficial bacteria (if from trusted sources). The issue is they have **300-400 kcal per 100g. It is a lot of calories**, compared to low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, which contain 70-80 kcal per 100g.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I can never eat 50-100g of whole cheese. I eat 200-300g, which is 1000kcal. Thus, I avoid it and stick to low-fat dairy.\r\n\r\n# Coconut oil\r\n\r\nI used to put coconut oil in almost anything for its miracle benefits. They say it contains a lot of MCT oil, which is used directly for energy and not stored as fat. I was a fool to believe it. Any oil is stored as fat if it leads to a daily calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, coconut oil is a better alternative to plant-seed oils as it doesn't oxidize so quickly and easily. However, you still need to pay attention to the quantities, as it is **900kcal per 100g** (100% fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRegardless if you're using coconut oil or any oil, use a spray. I spray my pan when frying anything. Don't just pour from the bottle. If you don't have a cooking spray, use a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n# Peanut/Almond/Cashew butter\r\n\r\nI was addicted to peanut butter, and since the day I quit eating it, I started losing fat without thinking about it. **Peanut butter has, indeed, 26g of protein per 100g and lots of minerals, but it comes with a price of 550 kcal - if 100% peanuts**. There are kinds of peanut butter with only 50% peanuts, and the rest is palm oil.

After the crash, we are hungry again.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Grains (pasta is from grains), dried fruits, sugar, and honey usually have 350kcal per 100g**.

The only way to achieve goals is by doing the work.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs simple as it sounds, **it is not easy at all**. The only thing that stays in our way to achieving anything in life is our ability to **decide to do work**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe biggest question is **how to decide** to do the work?

Every person would rather stay in bed and scroll Instagram or Facebook 24/7. It is so comfortable.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSuccessful people **decide** to do the work and **accept** it is the right thing to do. In the beginning, it is very hard, but in the long term, it becomes **automatic - a routine**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is the secret to progress in any area. **Create routines** so that you no longer need to think to do something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor me, eating healthily, exercising, cooking, working on my projects, waking without an alarm clock have become automatic. I\'ve been doing them for so long, they have become something natural and fun to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, you may ask: how to be motivated in the beginning, before creating a routine?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI will reveal two secrets:\r\n\r\n1.  **_Motivation is a tank that is full in the morning and empty in the evening;_**\r\n2.  **_Focus on long-term fulfillment and happiness than on short-term pleasures._**\r\n\r\nThese are the two secrets that helped me achieve anything.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always do the most important and most challenging things first thing in the morning because I am most motivated then.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI always think of: "How proud would I be of myself in the future if I looked back and saw myself choosing work instead of procrastination?". I also hate the guilt and frustration after not doing what I need to do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI can reframe everything in a single sentence: **do the difficult and disgusting things now; relax and enjoy later.** It is my main principle and philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***',html:"<p>Every person should have goals in life if he wants to have a meaningful life.

In this article, I will try to make you understand how human beings are meant to live and eliminate all possible confusions that dogmas have brought upon us.\r\n\r\nLet's forget everything we know for a second and have an overall picture of who and what we are.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we are mammals, and for millions of years, we have been living in the wild. In the last centuries, we have been more disconnected from our true nature than ever: living indoors, moving insufficiently, eating factory food products, sleeping out of sync and poorly, living inside our heads (overthinking/overstressing).\r\n\r\nAll other living beings except humans live in nature where they were destined to live. **Nature separation is where we have gone wrong.**\r\n\r\nIf we are meant to live in nature, we have to accept whatever and whenever nature has to offer.\r\n\r\nBut do we need?\r\n\r\n# Food\r\nWe need natural food. Food that is found almost ready to eat in nature and unaltered by man. We also need to keep in mind seasons and climate.\r\n\r\nWe are not herbivores, like elephants or giraffes, because we don't have big multi-chamber stomachs. We are also not carnivores (predators), because we don't have huge claws and teeth like tigers. We are something in between - **hunter-gatherers.**\r\n\r\nWe need to eat fresh vegetables and fruits (and some nuts and seeds from the shell) in seasons. The rest of the time, we need to hunt wild animals.\r\n\r\nWe also don't eat to eat all the time, because food may not be available all the time. Thus, **intermittent-fasting** may be in order as it is a natural thing to do, especially for consuming our stored energy (body fat).\r\n\r\nPracticality: **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting.**\r\n\r\n# Water\r\nNaturally (in the wild), we would drink only fresh spring water; hence, we should try to find the most unaltered water out there. Compared to regular tap water, spring water contains lots of minerals, and it is slightly alkaline.\r\n\r\nOf course, springs are not at every step, but we can there is **spring bottled water** in the markets. Just keep your eyes open for scams. Many bottles of water contain tap water.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more guaranteed, you can buy a water filter. The best one is the **reverse osmosis filter**. Other filters may also be fine if you are not living in polluted cities like New York.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **drink fresh spring water or purified water.**\r\n\r\n# Movement\r\nHunter-gatherers hunt and gather, which means spending most of the day on foot walking and carrying heavy things. Also, we need to ensure shelter which mens some hard labor. In some critical cases, we may also need to run to save our lives from predators.\r\n\r\nWe are meant to do **low-impact physical activity most of the day, mainly walking, and high-impact physical activity from time to time**.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\nAs wild animals, our circadian rhythms have been guided by the sun, and still is. Unfortunately, electricity (artificial light) has been messing up with our biological clock, and we no longer get the good quality sleep we once had.\r\n\r\nYou see, **sleep quantity is not that important**. Really! Have you ever heard people telling you they slept 6 hours, but still feel refreshed? Or, on the other side, have you ever heard people sleeping for 12 hours and always be tired?\r\n\r\nThe reason is the sleep quality.  The better the quality, the better the effect of sleep has on our body, like healing and assimilation.\r\n\r\nHow to achieve good quality sleep? We need to try to simulate the environment we once had back when we lived in the wild.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **go to bed and wake up at the same hours** (ideally, by the sun)**, avoid light before sleep** (>1 hour)**, and keep the bedroom dark and cool.**\r\n\r\n# Sunlight and Fresh Air\r\nThe only time we would spend inside would be during the night and bad weather. The rest of the time, wild humans would spend outside in the sunlight and fresh air. Nowadays, we spend most of our lives in boxes (houses, cars, buses, trains) which makes us deprived of fresh air and sunlight.\r\n\r\n**We need sunlight for vitamin D, which is a precursor for a lot of hormones.** We also need fresh air for oxygen, of course.\r\n\r\nNow, we live on a polluted planet, which is a big pitty, and we can hardly find fresh air. We don't need to be perfect, though, so **spending time in nature is enough.** \r\n\r\nPracticality: **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day.**\r\n\r\n# Relationships\r\nIf we look in nature, we see animal groups everywhere. Rarely animals live alone, including humans. **Humans are social beings**. We have evolved living in tribes and communities. We looked after one another, and this is what we should.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, technological evolution and its overuse have disconnected us from each other. Rarely we connect and spend good time with the people who matter. Social media is a major reason why depression and anxiety are on the rise.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch to this. You are better of living alone than with toxic people. I, for instance, spend most time alone, because I cannot find some people with whom I can resonate. I am happy, though. I feel free and limitless all the time.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **spend time with good quality people and avoid toxic people.**\r\n\r\n# Play\r\n\"Stop being a child! Grow up! Be serious!\" - They say.\r\n\r\nWe live in a serious world where being juvenile is a sin, especially making mistakes. This serious and super-fast world has made us forget to play and spend some regular leisure time.\r\n\r\nWe must be productive, right? Well, it seems that taking time to play and unwind can increase overall productivity.\r\n\r\nPlay can have any form, from playing a sport to spending time with the children or making a fool out of oneself. The idea is to **have fun and let the inner child come out**.\r\n\r\nPracticality: **have fun and enjoy life as often as possible**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   **eat freshly gathered vegetables and fruits with some nuts and seeds** (preferably, in your season and climate) **and wild-like (living like in the wild) animals.** Try **intermittent-fasting;**\r\n-   **drink fresh spring water or purified water;**\r\n-   **keep moving throughout the day**, mainly walking, **and engage in some regular high-intensity exercise**, like sprints and strength training;\r\n-   **go to bed and wake up at the same hours** (ideally, by the sun)**, avoid light before sleep** (>1 hour)**, and keep the bedroom dark and cool;**\r\n-   **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day;**\r\n-   **spend time with good quality people and avoid toxic people;**\r\n-   **have fun and enjoy life as often as possible**.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n",html:"<p>Ask two people or health experts what a healthy lifestyle looks like, and you will probably receive different answers.

Sometimes I skip fasting because of some events. However, I fast 16 hours 6 times per week.\n\nEver since I started to fast, I feel free, and I control my weight and lifestyle, not the other way around.\n\n# References\n\n1.

It may sound like a fairytale, but it is possible in the world of investing. I entered this world three years ago, and I lost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore we begin with my investing mistakes, let's understand what investing is. In the simplest terms, investing is saving money and making them work for you. The money you invest is called capital.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can read more about investing basics on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp) as it exceeds the scope of this article. I also recommend reading \"The Richest Man In Babylon,\" \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\" and \"The Intelligent Investor.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my investing journey, I made the mistakes the books above tell not to do. Hence, I lost about $5000. It may sound a little to some people, but for me, it is a lot of money.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI learned after so money years that I wasn't investing but gambling because I didn't know what I was doing, which brings me to my worst mistake.\r\n\r\n# Not Knowing What You're Investing In\r\n\r\nIf you're buying stocks, commodities, forex, crypto, or any other market just by analyzing a chart or by following the herd, you're not investing but gambling. You're better off betting in sports or playing in a casino.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy biggest mistake was not reading and informing myself enough. The biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffet, reads 8 hours per day about finance and the economy. When he invests, he knows for sure his investment will grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're investing, for example, in Amazon stock, don't just blindly invest because you herd Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet (or was before he divorced) or because it is in the top 10 companies in the world. It is not necessarily a good investment now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRead, read, read, and read again.\r\n\r\n# I Want Profit Now\r\n\r\nAnother mistake I made was wanting to make a lot of profit as soon as possible. It is truly a fairytale and a one in a million situations unless you have such a large capital that you invest in crypto at the right moment and a big spike happens like in 2017.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recently realized that investing is making a reasonable profit in more than five years. It applies to start-ups too; don't expect a large income in months, only in years or even decades.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want more money now, ask for a raise or get a better job.\r\n\r\n# Getting Emotional On Volatility\r\n\r\nI don't know if you've ever seen a market trend, but it is not smoothly going up or down. Trends have ups and downs that it is why trend moving averages are useful to determine the long term trend.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI made the mistake of exiting a bullish (up) long term trend because it became bearish (down) for the short term. It is ok to change directions from time to time. The intelligent investor buys when down trends happen after reversals because the market riched a new low.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nInvesting is buying a book worth $10 for $9 or less. If you see something of high value that a low price at the moment, then it is an opportunity to invest and wait. Always look at the big picture and don't be moved by periods of volatility.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, stay informed, as we can't guarantee that the change in direction is not the next long-term direction. For instance, Warren Buffet sold bank and airline stocks due to the pandemic which cause a global lockdown and economic crisis.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you think the trend is at its highest, sell if the market is about to reverse and enter again only if the market rebounds.\r\n\r\n# Ignoring The Leverage\r\n\r\nLeverage is a tool the allows an investor to multiply his investment by a given ratio. I lost the most amount of money because of this.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf the trend goes in your favor, you will make a lot of money in a short amount of time. However, you can also lose a lot of money in a snap; it happened to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI gambled on products with leverage that went well for a while, then reversed, and it cost me dearly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNever use leverage tool, or invest small amounts. You can win a lot but can lose a lot. It is better to go on a low-risk small win than a high-risk big win (from my experience).\r\n\r\n# Not Diversifying\r\n\r\nI used to invest in a single market a large amount of my capital: big mistake.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlways look for multiple opportunities or invest small fractions of your capital. The logic is simple: if one market goes down, there is a weak chance the others also go down, unless they are related.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDiversification means investing in different areas, not just in different markets or companies. For instance, investing in 10 airline companies is not necessarily a diversification.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like to invest in tech companies because I am a tech guy and because I believe they frame the future. You should do your research and invest in something that represents you and in which you have faith.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n***If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.***",html:"<p>Every person dreams of money falling from the sky.

The money you invest is called capital.</p>\n<p>You can read more about investing basics on <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp\">Investopedia</a> as it exceeds the scope of this article. I also recommend reading &quot;The Richest Man In Babylon,&quot; &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad,&quot; and &quot;The Intelligent Investor.&quot;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of my investing journey, I made the mistakes the books above tell not to do. Hence, I lost about $5000. It may sound a little to some people, but for me, it is a lot of money.</p>\n<p>I learned after so money years that I wasn't investing but gambling because I didn't know what I was doing, which brings me to my worst mistake.</p>\n<h1>Not Knowing What You're Investing In</h1>\n<p>If you're buying stocks, commodities, forex, crypto, or any other market just by analyzing a chart or by following the herd, you're not investing but gambling. You're better off betting in sports or playing in a casino.</p>\n<p>My biggest mistake was not reading and informing myself enough. The biggest investor in the world, Warren Buffet, reads 8 hours per day about finance and the economy. When he invests, he knows for sure his investment will grow.</p>\n<p>If you're investing, for example, in Amazon stock, don't just blindly invest because you herd Jeff Bezos is the richest man on the planet (or was before he divorced) or because it is in the top 10 companies in the world. It is not necessarily a good investment now.</p>\n<p>Read, read, read, and read again.</p>\n<h1>I Want Profit Now</h1>\n<p>Another mistake I made was wanting to make a lot of profit as soon as possible. It is truly a fairytale and a one in a million situations unless you have such a large capital that you invest in crypto at the right moment and a big spike happens like in 2017.</p>\n<p>I recently realized that investing is making a reasonable profit in more than five years. It applies to start-ups too; don't expect a large income in months, only in years or even decades.</p>\n<p>If you want more money now, ask for a raise or get a better job.</p>\n<h1>Getting Emotional On Volatility</h1>\n<p>I don't know if you've ever seen a market trend, but it is not smoothly going up or down. Trends have ups and downs that it is why trend moving averages are useful to determine the long term trend.</p>\n<p>I made the mistake of exiting a bullish (up) long term trend because it became bearish (down) for the short term. It is ok to change directions from time to time. The intelligent investor buys when down trends happen after reversals because the market riched a new low.</p>\n<p>Investing is buying a book worth $10 for $9 or less. If you see something of high value that a low price at the moment, then it is an opportunity to invest and wait. Always look at the big picture and don't be moved by periods of volatility.</p>\n<p>However, stay informed, as we can't guarantee that the change in direction is not the next long-term direction. For instance, Warren Buffet sold bank and airline stocks due to the pandemic which cause a global lockdown and economic crisis.</p>\n<p>When you think the trend is at its highest, sell if the market is about to reverse and enter again only if the market rebounds.</p>\n<h1>Ignoring The Leverage</h1>\n<p>Leverage is a tool the allows an investor to multiply his investment by a given ratio. I lost the most amount of money because of this.</p>\n<p>If the trend goes in your favor, you will make a lot of money in a short amount of time. However, you can also lose a lot of money in a snap; it happened to me.</p>\n<p>I gambled on products with leverage that went well for a while, then reversed, and it cost me dearly.</p>\n<p>Never use leverage tool, or invest small amounts. You can win a lot but can lose a lot. It is better to go on a low-risk small win than a high-risk big win (from my experience).</p>\n<h1>Not Diversifying</h1>\n<p>I used to invest in a single market a large amount of my capital: big mistake.</p>\n<p>Always look for multiple opportunities or invest small fractions of your capital. The logic is simple: if one market goes down, there is a weak chance the others also go down, unless they are related.</p>\n<p>Diversification means investing in different areas, not just in different markets or companies. For instance, investing in 10 airline companies is not necessarily a diversification.</p>\n<p>I like to invest in tech companies because I am a tech guy and because I believe they frame the future. You should do your research and invest in something that represents you and in which you have faith.</p>\n<br>\n<p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this article, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, share it with your friends, and stay tuned for more.</strong></em></p>\n",attributes:{id:"how-not-to-invest",author:"Razvan Tomegea",title:"How Not To Invest?

So, what is this? Glad you asked. This is the Wyckoff Method. In Layman’s terms:\n\n> The Wyckoff Method is a method of determining when a market is manipulated by big guys — “Composite man” — into their advantage.\n\nYou read right, manipulated. The method was developed for stocks, but it can be applied to any market, including our new crypto market.\n\nThe Wyckoff method describes two chart patterns of manipulation, which can predict long-term movement: **distribution and accumulation**.\n\nIn the distribution pattern, big guys (“Whales”, “the Composite man”, etc.) sell their shares and manipulate the market into a downtrend.\n\nIn the accumulation phase, big guys buy as many cheap shares as possible and then manipulate the market into an uptrend\n\nIn the crypto arena, Bitcoin is the market mover. Where Bitcoin goes, the market eventually flows. Thus, by looking at the Bitcoin 1D chart, we see almost perfectly a **Wyckoff distribution** chart pattern.

Of course, I may be wrong, nothing is certain. In this case, I will buy back in at 43k, after the 42k resistance is broken.\n\nNow, I won’t buy only Bitcoin. As I said, everything goes down sooner or later following Bitcoin, as we saw in May and along the years.\n\nThe last time I saw a [bearish indicator or pattern](https://razvantomegea.medium.com/after-the-crash-this-bitcoin-indicator-knew-it-all-along-439633cea698) and didn’t follow the plan, I lost half my money (all my profit).

However, they are **far from being equal**. You can be fit but sick, and you can be healthy but slightly overweight.\n\nFor example, avocados and nuts may be healthy, but they are high in calories. As a result, they can easily make you gain body fat.\n\nI have put my body through experiments and analyzed many diets until I found **reusable habits that work**.\n\nTo give you some context, I went **from an overweight child to anorexic, fat, and skinny fat**. Now, I consider myself fit and at my peak.\n\nI also went vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, pescetarian, fruitarian, paleo, and primal. None of them worked for me.\n\n**_Here’s the thing, if you can’t stick to a routine for life while enjoying it and living your life, don’t even bother._**\n\nWe need to understand that our **body needs special attention** — sleep, nutrition, movement, water, sun, fresh air — but **our soul does too** by experiencing the things we like. Balance is everything.\n\nEnough foreplay. Let’s get to the tips. Keep in mind that **order does not matter.**\n\n# Lots of vegetables and fruits\n\nVegetables and fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and water. All sustainable and healthy diets recommend eating lots of vegetables and fruits.\n\nAlso, let’s be honest. We have **evolved from primates**, and all primates eat vegetables and fruits as their primary source of food.\n\nI eat vegetables every day and fruit as a snack. In summer, when vegetables and fruits are in season in my country, I eat lots of salads and fruits like watermelon, peaches, apricots, and berries. I track all my foods using the [Bodily app](https://bodily.app).\n\nWhen I say vegetables, **I don’t mean grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds**, which are all the “eggs” of the plant. I mean the leaf and the “fruit” of the plant. Also, when I say fruits, I mean fresh ones, not dried ones.\n\nVegetable examples: **broccoli, green peas, green beans, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, celery, spinach, onions, garlic,** and so on.\n\nFruit examples: **blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, watermelon, apples, peaches, nectarines, grapefruit, oranges, clementines, kiwi, apricots, bananas, cherries**, and so on.\n\n# Low-fat animal products\n\nAnimal products are the primary source of protein and other stored minerals and fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nHowever, animal products can be a source of calories and toxins if eaten with full-fat content. **Fat is not just energy storage but also toxin storage**.\n\nAlso, why would you eat the full-fat animal product when [you can eat more](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/you-can-eat-more-and-lose-body-fat-with-this-secret-no-one-told-you) just by choosing the lower fat version? Most animal products are not protein sources but fat sources, like rib-eye steak and ricotta cheese.\n\nI am **not saying fat is unhealthy**; I am saying fat the highest calorie content, lowest volume, and, hence, you can gain body fat by eating more dietary fat.\n\nFrom my experience and other professional reviews (Greg Doucette, Jeff Cavaliere, Jonathan Bailor), eating low-fat — not non-fat — foods helped me stay fit and energetic without trying too hard.\n\nExamples: **egg whites, low-fat greek yogurt, low-fat cottage cheese, chicken breast, turkey breast, low-fat pork, low-fat beef, tuna, salmon (for omega-3)**, and so on.\n\n# Zero or low-calorie condiments\n\nIf our food doesn’t taste good, we won’t stick to our diet plan. Condiments and spices are a must in food preparation.\n\nI know these zero-calorie condiments may not be so healthy, but they are healthier than the regular ones, and they help us stay fit.\n\nAlso, zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are far better than sugar if you have a sweet tooth. 4mg are equal to 100g of sugar, I think.\n\nExamples: **mustard, herbs, zero or low-calorie ketchup, zero-calorie barbecue sauce, sucralose**, and so on.\n\n# A lot of water\n\nWater is our second requirement after oxygen. We are also made 70% from water. Among many other things, water is **almost free, has zero calories, feels our stomach, and gives us energy**.\n\nDid you know that **many times our hunger or desire for sweets is water thirst in disguise**? Next time you have the desire to eat something sweet, drink some water.\n\nI use the [Bodily app](https://bodily.app/) to track my water intake and know if I achieve my daily water goals, which vary depending on my lifestyle, body, and other factors.\n\nIf you want to know how much water you need, I invite you to use the app and drink as much water as possible.\n\nPro tip: **I drink a lot of tea**, which helps me achieve my daily water requirements. I also drink **1 liter of water first thing in the morning**.\n\n# Regular sleep schedule\n\nSleep **quality is more important than quantity**. It doesn’t matter that you sleep 9 hours per night if your bedtime and wake-up time is chaotic. Your body won’t get the deep sleep it needs.\n\nI **fall asleep at around 11:00 p.m. and wake up around 07:00 a.m.** every day, with some exceptions on Sundays.\n\nNow, the hours don’t matter necessarily. Maybe you function better if you fall asleep at 09:00 and wake up at 05:00 a.m or you fall asleep at 02:00 a.m. and wake up at 09:00 a.m. The **body can adapt to any sleep schedule**.\n\nForget about those cookie cutter recommendations of waking up at 05:00 a.m. It’s garbage. We are different.\n\nNow, sleep **duration also matters, but it is no fixed**. Some people can sleep 6 hours per night and be at their maximum, whereas others need 10 hours. I found that I need 8–9 hours.\n\nI also use the [Bodily app](https://bodily.app) to track my sleep schedule and quality. It indicates if your sleep is ok, based on your body’s information.\n\n# Full body intense training\n\nIf you want to learn more about my workout routine, I wrote two articles on this topic: [The Last Muscle Building Guide You’ll Ever Need To Become Big As Possible](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-last-muscle-building-guide-youll-ever-need-to-become-big-as-possible) and [My Workout Routine](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/my-workout-routine).\n\nI work out my **entire body three times per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By intense, I mean **I take 1–2 minute breaks, and every rep is hard and performed correctly**.\n\nAs we age, our growth hormone, testosterone, and lean muscle mass decrease. As a result, we look older. Thus, training our entire body is required for both men and women who want to stay young and vigorous.\n\nIt’s not about being big, but about being able to perform our day-to-day activities with ease. We also don’t need to make the gym our new home. A minimalistic yet effective workout plan is enough to do the job.\n\nIf you have no ideas what exercises to do or how to perform them correctly, you can find any activity on the [Bodily app](https://bodily.app) and create your workouts with sessions, reps, and all that stuff.\n\n# A lot of walking outside\n\nWalking is medicine. Not only is walking the most underrated exercise but also therapy. I walk 12km or 15.000 steps every other day when I don’t do my intense training. This cumulates into an average of **60.000 steps per week**.\n\nOf course, you don’t need to do as many steps as I do. You can start walking 1000 steps per day if you can be consistent. Keep in mind that **steps in the house don’t count**.\n\nThe idea is to disconnect and go outside. Get some fresh air and sunlight. It is the only way to embrace the full benefits of walking.\n\nAlso, walking outside for 1–2 hours is a perfect way to burn body fat, especially if done on an empty stomach. I walk in the late morning on an empty stomach during my 16-hour fasting window.\n\n**The body utilizes body fat as fuel mostly during low-intensity movement**. During high-intensity movement, the body relies on blood glucose and glycogen. Of course, to burn fat and keep it off, you must also be in a caloric deficit.\n\nSo, develop a walking routine and stick to it with ease. Start small and increase gradually. I also posted an article on walking [here.](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/why-walking-is-the-best-exercise)\n\n# Laughter and gratitude\n\nNow, being healthy is not only about diet, exercise, and sleep. Being healthy — and fit — is also about our mind and soul. We need to be happy, and happiness comes from being grateful and laughing as often as possible.\n\nIf you’re not laughing and not being grateful, I assume you live a miserable life, regardless of all your achievements.\n\nI remind myself every night and morning how lucky I am because I am healthy, fit, young, handsome, wise, calm, and many other things. I also remind myself how lucky I am to be surrounded by the people I love.\n\nFor sure, you have things to be grateful for; if not, let me tell you something powerful: **for every asset you have** (e.g., shelter, health, food), **a person is praying for it.**\n\nI try to watch some comedies as often as possible, but it is hard to find some good movies these days. **Do you know some great comedies? Comment down below.**\n\nI found 9gag is very amusing, and I laugh easily. Hack, I even laugh at my jokes sometimes when I am relaxed. The idea is to laugh as often as possible. **Laughing boost immunity and relaxes the body, among other benefits.**\n\nThus, be grateful and laugh. It’s free, simple, and good for you. What more do you want?\n\n# Learn new things\n\nAs I said, we need to train our entire body, including our most important muscle: the brain. The best way to do it is by learning new things.\n\nI found **learning new things keeps me curious, young, and purposeful.** Learning new things helps us evolve, and **if we are not evolving, we are devolving.** There is no middle ground.\n\nThe best way to learn new things is by **reading or listening to books**. I know it is not comfortable, but books are a great way to relax, especially before bed.\n\nChoose a **topic that you like** (e.g., health, fitness, technology, fiction, science-fiction, autobiographies, self-development, etc.) and start training your brain.\n\nI am currently reading: “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking. I enjoy all the topics mentioned above.\n\n# Take a break\n\nNow that we discussed the things we should do, it’s time to discuss what not to do. We need to take breaks  from time to time; otherwise, we will experience **burnout or chronic fatigue**.\n\nHave you ever slept for 10 hours but still feel exhausted? Well, you were experiencing chronic fatigue or burnout. When you experience things like this, going to a medic will most likely reveal nothing. Of course, I am not recommending avoiding a doctor when you feel ill.\n\nAt least on **Sundays or once a month, schedule a break from everything**. This includes eating healthy and exercising if that is a stress to you. In my case, Sundays are free, and I don’t make plans. I do whatever I please.\n\n\n> Disclaimer: I am not a health and fitness professional. Everything I write on the topic is for informational and educational purposes only.

Meditation’s primary purpose is to train your mind and be present. You are also facing your thoughts, emotions, and inner world.\n\nThrough meditation, you will develop the discipline to control yourself and to no longer be in reaction. You will become more confident, calmer, and happier. You will also be able to sleep better and focus better.\n\n# 5.

There is and always will be one of you in this life.\n\nDon’t be too rough on yourself and accept you made and will make mistakes.

Keeping this in mind, I decided to write some of the daily habits that help me stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\nI also put an almost naked picture with me to show you that I am not a fat guy, just writing articles out of my experience. Now, I am not a good photographer, and the picture is not that professional or artistic, but it does its job showing that I am pretty fit: I am 1.80m, weigh 79kg, and my body fat percentage is around 12%.\r\n\r\nIn this article, I will cover my **diet, exercise, and sleep habits.**\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\n\r\nI usually have **two meals and two snacks a day**, and my main food groups are **vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.** I also drink **at least three liters of water** per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI start the day by drinking 1 liter of water, a **protein shake with greens powder** and creatine (around 200kcal), and with some **coffee**. After I do some work, I prepare my first main meal, usually around 11:00 a.m. The **whey protein shake, creatine, greens powder, vitamin D3, medicinal mushrooms (for immunity) are the only supplements I take.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy first main meal is usually an **omelet** (five eggs and six egg whites), two cans of **grilled mackerel in water**, three slices of **toast bread**, some **tomatoes**, some **red peppers**, some **greek yogurt**, some **fruit**, and some **green tea**. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe second meal is usually around 5:00 p.m., and I will have **some lean meat with vegetables**. It can be grilled **chicken breast**, baked **sweet potatoes**, and some **salad** in some days. On other days, it can be some grilled **beef** with **potatoes** and salad. Sometimes I will make a **stew** with lots of vegetables and lean meat. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter this meal, I will eat some **fruit**, depending on the season. It can be watermelon, peaches, nectarines, blackberries, apples, cherries, clementines, etc. This snack is around 300kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like consistency. **I enjoy eating the same foods**, my favorite foods, over and over again. It requires less mental energy. I never have cheat meals because I don't need them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are days and periods I am away from home, or I hang out with my friends, girlfriend, or (and) family. When this happens, I focus on my favorite food groups: vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. If these are not present, I eat small portions of something similar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI drink alcohol on occasions, but only when I have a day off from everything the next day, usually on Saturday or Friday. When I drink, I choose low-calorie drinks, like wine, cognac, or \"rachiu\" (a beverage from Romania similar to tequila, but better).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI try to avoid, when not at home, fried foods, fatty foods, and deserts. These are high in calories, low in volume, and highly palatable. They make me eat them without stopping.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy strategy is to **eat foods high in volume, rich in water, fiber, and protein, and low in calories**. It is the reason why I eat vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. These foods fill me up with the least amount of calories. They also offer me all the essential nutrients I need: amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't keep in my house trigger foods, foods that I like so much that I cannot stop eating them after I begin. For me, these foods are peanut butter and coconut, or foods containing them. I like them so much that I cannot stop myself at a bite.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be as lean as possible. Of course, I want to increase my muscle mass as well, but I don't think I have the genetics to be a monster. To achieve my goal, I stay in a constant calorie deficit or maintenance at a maximum and eat sufficient protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My daily requirements are ~3000kcal, and I eat ~2500kcal.** Some days I burn less and eat less. It depends. I also aim to consume **200g protein per day,** to build and preserve my muscle mass, and 100g fats. I don't care how much carbs I consume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **eat only foods you enjoy and avoid trigger foods, but make sure they are high in volume and low in calories.**\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nI love walking. I **walk everyday 6-15km**. During these sessions, I burn 350-900kcal. It is an exercise I can do regardless of the weather, with any equipment, anywhere, any time. It also helps me relax, makes me feel better, and sleep better.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am also a fan of strength training. **I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and train all the muscle groups in one session**. For a while, I went to the gym six days per week, using the push-pull-legs split, but it was too exhausting, and I didn't have the Saturday off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe full-body training split ensures I equally train all the muscle groups, and I have a rest day between sessions for my muscles and nervous system to recover. I also have the weekends off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **do the exercises you enjoy and which you can stick to** regardless of external circumstances.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is so underrated these days. We cannot make wise decisions and function at our full potential without good quality sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sleep, it is not much to say. I **fall asleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 08:00 a.m.** every day. Sometimes, on weekends, I go to bed later and wake up later, but not every weekend. Whenever I can, I stick to my sleeping schedule, and I aim **towards 8-9 hours of sleep per night.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have some habits before bed, though. **After 10:30 p.m. (1 hour before sleep), all lights are turned off** and avoid them. Artificial lights make me alert and disrupt my melatonin (sleep hormone) levels. Maybe it happens to you too. I also **keep the room dark as a cave and not too warm.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn my phone and laptop, I use the Iris app to filter out blue light, which hurts my eyes and disrupts my sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed that chamomile tea before bed helps me sleep a lot better, so I drink 2-4 cups before bed. When I don't have tea, I take a sleep supplement with valerian root, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d3, and melatonin. I don't recommend any supplements to anyone; I am just informing what I do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours** so that the body sets its circadian rhythm. Also, avoid any form of artificial light 1 hour before bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat is all my friends. The big lesson you need to take from this article is to **create a routine for life that you enjoy.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I eat foods high in volume and low in calories (vegetables, fruit, and lean meats), that I enjoy, and avoid foods that I can't stop eating;\r\n-   I walk every day and train my entire body three times per week;\r\n-   I go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours, and avoid artificial light one hour before bed;\r\n-   one day per week, I don't stick to my routines and enjoy life with my loved ones.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",html:"<p>I am a big believer in the power of example, and I am better off applying what a person does by watching her than taking advice from her.

There are many guides out there on the web, so why even bother you may think? Let's say, repetition is key to memorization. It's never a bad thing to review what you already know.\r\n\r\nI believe nutrition is one of the essential pieces of the health and fitness puzzle.\r\n\r\nWhat is nutrition? Nutrition is a science. **Nutrition is the science of how food components (nutrients) transform and interact within our bodies**. Thus, our focus is on what those food components nutrients are and what they do.\r\n\r\n# Nutrients\r\n\r\nOur body requires the nutrient compounds present in food. The more nutrient-dense food is, the higher it's quality.\r\n\r\n## Macronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Carbohydrates;\r\n-   Proteins;\r\n-   Lipids;\r\n-   Water.\r\n\r\n## Micronutrients\r\n\r\n-   Vitamins;\r\n-   Minerals.\r\n\r\nWe should no longer see food as just belly-filling, hunger inhibiting substance. Food should be cellular nourishment.\r\n\r\n## Essential nutrients\r\n\r\nNow, upon these nutrients, not all of them are essential. Some of them can be produced internally by the body (non-essential). Our focus should be mostly on the essential nutrients.\r\n\r\n-   **Water**;\r\n-   **Major Minerals** (Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium);\r\n-   **Trace Minerals** (Iron, Iodine, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cobalt, Chromium, Selenium, Molybdenum, Fluorine);\r\n-   **Amino Acids** (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine);\r\n-   **Fatty Acids** (Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid);\r\n-   **Vitamins** (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine, Biotin, Folic acid, Cobalamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Choline).\r\n\r\nIn the next articles, we'll focus on each nutrient group.

You have the money, the time, the motivation to get started. Still, I genuinely believe you need to have some essential points in mind coming from my personal experience of a consistent workout routine (13 years).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't go to the gym as I invested in equipment and work out at home 6 times per week.\r\n\r\nYou can read my article on \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle)\" for more detailed bodybuilding information. Also, \"[The Secrets Of Fat Loss](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-secrets-of-fat-loss)\" offers comprehensive information on how to lose fat, not just weight.\r\n\r\n# Consistency\r\n\r\nIt is not what you do once in a while that counts; it is what you do consistently. If you want to see results from your hard work, you need to be consistent.\r\n\r\n3 times per week is an ideal gym schedule for busy people. If you have more time and enjoy going to the gym, 6 times per week is perfect.\r\n\r\n# Form & Execution\r\n\r\nYou will see huge guys and maybe women lifting very heavy dumbbells and barbells. Don't be discouraged. Everybody started small.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to the gym just for aerobics, start with small intervals. It's ok if you cannot complete the entire workout in the beginning.\r\n\r\nRemember, focus on each repetition or interval and on your breath. Many professional bodybuilders sacrifice good form and cheat their reps just to lift heavy. That is wrong and leads to injury.\r\n\r\nStart small and continuously progress (increase the sets, reps, weights, distance, pace, etc.). to avoid a plateau. You can also switch the exercise routine to prevent acclimatization to the exercise. Check \"[The Fundamentals Of Building Muscle](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle).\"\r\n\r\n# Duration\r\n\r\nYou don't need to spend more than 1 hour in the gym. An intense and heavy workout can be completed in less than 1 hour if you are focused and don't waste time.\r\n\r\nIf you are doing aerobics/cardio and don't have your heart raised to 150 bpm and not sweating, you are not working intensely enough.\r\n\r\nIf you are lifting weights and don't feel the pump or burn, you are not lifting correctly or heavy enough.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\n\r\nExercise is just a tiny part of the equation. Regardless of your goals, you need to have a healthy, balanced diet.\r\n\r\nWant to build muscle? More calories (10%) and protein.\r\nWant to burn fat? Fewer calories (10%) and intermittent fasting.\r\nWant to be healthy? Eat natural, unprocessed food.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to restrict carbs or fat or anything. Just eat real food as natural and minimally processed as possible. This implies a lot of home preparation and cooking.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to drink lots of water. 3L per day is optimal. If you also live in a hot climate or it is summer, 5L is optimal.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nThe body needs to recover. The body is broken down and stressed out in the gym. It is during sleep when the muscle cells are rebuilt and when our healing hormones are secreted.\r\n\r\nA regular sleep schedule is the hardest thing to do in this century. Everybody hates going early to bed. How can we skip going out or watching the latest episode of Money Heist on Netflix?\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want results, you need to sleep from 10:00 pm to 4-5 am at least 5 days per week. Sleep quantity is not that important as sleep quality. 6-7 hours of good quality sleep is perfect. If you have time to sleep more, good for you.\r\n\r\n# Supplements\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, you don't need any supplements. What you need is correct exercise execution and constant progress, a nutritious and balanced diet, and good quality sleep. That's it!\r\n\r\nAfter you've maintained a routine for at least a year, then you can start investing in supplements.\r\n\r\nWhat most fitness addicts recommend is:\r\n\r\n-   whey isolate protein (or pea + hemp protein mix if you're a vegan);\r\n-   l-glutamine;\r\n-   creatine monohydrate;\r\n-   l-carnitine;\r\n-   organic vitamins and minerals complex;\r\n-   krill oil;\r\n-   for lazy days, a pre-workout (citrulline malate, beta-alanine, caffeine).\r\n\r\nAny other supplement is not worth the hype.\r\n\r\n# Patience\r\n\r\nLower your expectations. Don't expect to see significant results in just a month. If you would like to be like Dwayne Johnson, keep in mind that he has been having a healthy and disciplined lifestyle (exercise, diet, sleep) for 10+ years. He is also has a genetically large bone structure.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you would kile to be 6% body fat and have been fat in the past, you need to track your diet plan very strictly.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n",html:"<p>So you decided you want to buy a gym membership for whatever reason: build muscle, burn fat, improve your health, or maybe all of them.

experience that trading is bullshit. Why? Because of these two laws of the stock market.\r\n\r\nTrading relies on technical analysis to predict the market. 90% of traders who rely on technical analysis lose money, according to  [Bill Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNxt298VVOw&list=PLp9LyEgIX9p8UqlZnVAcKnOeRwSxOM6B6).\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Wolf Of Wallstreet? The character played by Matthew McConaughey said:\r\n\r\n> “No one can predict if the stock market is going up, down, sideways, or in frickin circles.”\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the 10% traders who makes profit long term, good for you. For me and the other 90% of traders doesn’t work. So what should we do instead? We should cleverly invest long-term.\r\n\r\nWe should research in advance of any investment initially. Afterward, we must buy and hold for at least 3–5 years. We must also periodically analyze each investment to be sure it is still a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhy hold for years? Here’s why:\r\n\r\n# 1. The stock market will always crash\r\n\r\nWe have seen through time that recessions occur. It is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Unfortunately, we can never predict when a stock market will crash.\r\n\r\nJust look at the stock and real estate market now during the pandemic. The government prints trillions of dollars and euros, unemployment is going up, money does no longer circulate because people stay at home, but the stock and real market are going up.\r\n\r\nCheck this video from Ray Dalio on  [How the economy works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=1s). He explains how the economy works and why we are in a new great depression.\r\n\r\nRecessions occur every few decades that cause the stock market to crash and come back only after 3–5 years.\r\n\r\nIt is the reason for holding for at least 3–5 years. In case of a crash, the market will have time to bounce back, and you won’t be at a loss.\r\n\r\n# 2.

I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.\r\n\r\nThus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.\r\n\r\n# How and why the muscle grows?\r\n\r\nIn nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.\r\n\r\n> The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.\r\n\r\nSimple, right?\r\n\r\nIt is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.\r\n\r\n# Workout structure\r\n\r\nYour workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only **compound movements** (multiple muscle groups per movement).\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.\r\n\r\nOf course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to **avoid machines**, we will be using **only free weights and/or resistance bands**. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the exercises:\r\n\r\n-   chest: **bench press and incline bench press** (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);\r\n-   back: **pull-ups/chin-ups/pull-downs and rows**;\r\n-   legs: **squats and deadlifts** (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol/Bulgarian/split squats);\r\n-   shoulders: **shoulder press and lateral raises**;\r\n-   biceps: **curls**;\r\n-   triceps: **dips, push-downs, and/or skull crushers**;\r\n-   (optional) calves: calve raises**;**\r\n-   (optional) abs: leg raises.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.\r\n\r\n# Exercise execution\r\n\r\nHow we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.\r\n\r\nEach exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on **6–10 challenging reps**, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (**1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric**.)\r\n\r\nLet’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:\r\n\r\n-   when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);\r\n-   you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;\r\n-   when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).\r\n\r\nWe will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.\r\n\r\nFor the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.\r\n\r\n# Workout sessions\r\n\r\nYou can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:\r\n\r\n-   **push/pull/legs** (Monday to Saturday);\r\n-   **upper/lower** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);\r\n-   **full-body** (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\r\n\r\nI do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.\r\n\r\n# Diet and sleep\r\n\r\nNow that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. **Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic**.\r\n\r\nYou need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, **lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs & egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits**.\r\n\r\nIf you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You **don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements** unless you have money to spare.\r\n\r\nFor sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday**, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.\r\n\r\nI found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me.

I feel you, you are a busy person with limited time, like me. You don’t have time to read all the mambo jumbo.</p>\n<p>Thus, here we are with this simple yet effective guide.</p>\n<h1>How and why the muscle grows?</h1>\n<p>In nature, growth happens after being exposed to acute stress (stimulus), followed by recovery. The muscle does the same. Expose it to just enough acute stress, followed by recovery, and your muscle will grow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The stress is of course resistance training and the recovery is diet and sleep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Simple, right?</p>\n<p>It is simple, but the fitness industry bullshit has complicated things so much that people become overwhelmed. Forget everything and stick to this basic science.</p>\n<h1>Workout structure</h1>\n<p>Your workout should target all muscle groups directly and indirectly if you want to have an overall strong and developed body. To achieve this we need to do only <strong>compound movements</strong> (multiple muscle groups per movement).</p>\n<p>Now, if you are a professional bodybuilder, you will need to target each muscle group and part directly. That’s okay, but this article is mostly for simple people who don’t have time, knowledge, and energy to do all the exercises.</p>\n<p>Of course, we will be doing so isolation exercises for the arms and shoulders, because we are men. If you are a woman, you will be doing some isolation exercises for the legs and hips. It’s your choice; your gender is not important here.</p>\n<p>The main idea is to <strong>avoid machines</strong>, we will be using <strong>only free weights and/or resistance bands</strong>. You may be asking why. Because it is a versatile, simple, and time-proof workout, which prevents you from making excuses.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the exercises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chest: <strong>bench press and incline bench press</strong> (or push-ups with different angles and resistance);</li>\n<li>back: <strong>pull-ups/chin-ups/pull-downs and rows</strong>;</li>\n<li>legs: <strong>squats and deadlifts</strong> (if no or minimal equipment, try pistol/Bulgarian/split squats);</li>\n<li>shoulders: <strong>shoulder press and lateral raises</strong>;</li>\n<li>biceps: <strong>curls</strong>;</li>\n<li>triceps: <strong>dips, push-downs, and/or skull crushers</strong>;</li>\n<li>(optional) calves: calve raises**;**</li>\n<li>(optional) abs: leg raises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These exercises can be done anywhere, at any time, only with dumbells, a barbell, or resistance bands.</p>\n<h1>Exercise execution</h1>\n<p>How we do the exercises is as important or even more important than what exercise we do. We need to perform each exercise and repetition with patience and correctness.</p>\n<p>Each exercise set needs to be challenging and needs to last 30–60 seconds. To achieve this, we need to focus on <strong>6–10 challenging reps</strong>, done in the tempo 1–1–3 (<strong>1-second concentric, 1-second isometric, 3-second eccentric</strong>.)</p>\n<p>Let’s apply this theory to a push-up or bench press:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when pushing, it needs to be explosive (1 second);</li>\n<li>you need to keep the resistance (body or weights up) for 1 second;</li>\n<li>when lowering your body or weights, you need to do it as slowly as possible (3–4 seconds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will always start with a weight that you can do 10 reps at maximum. If you can do 11 or more, you need to increase the weight. In the last set, you must be able to do 6 reps at a minimum, otherwise lower the weight.</p>\n<p>For the big muscle groups, we will do 4 sets, whereas for the small ones we will do 3 sets.</p>\n<h1>Workout sessions</h1>\n<p>You can split the workouts however you want, but you need to work out each muscle group 2–3 times per week. Thus, the only choices you have are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>push/pull/legs</strong> (Monday to Saturday);</li>\n<li><strong>upper/lower</strong> (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday);</li>\n<li><strong>full-body</strong> (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do a full-body workout because it works best for me and my schedule. You can choose any of the 3 splits above.</p>\n<h1>Diet and sleep</h1>\n<p>Now that we know how to stress the muscle, we need to help it recover and grow. Remember, growth happens mostly after the stress during recovery. <strong>Stress is always catabolic, not anabolic</strong>.</p>\n<p>You need to ensure you eat foods high in protein, carbohydrates, essential fats, vitamins, and minerals. In other words, <strong>lean meats, low-fat dairy, eggs &amp; egg whites, fatty cold-water fish, vegetables, and fruits</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you can and want to, you can buy a multi-vita-mineral complex and fish oil to be sure you have all you need (I do). You <strong>don’t need protein shakes and other hyped fitness supplements</strong> unless you have money to spare.</p>\n<p>For sleep, it is simple: go to bed and wake up at the same hours, and make sure you have 7–9 hours of sleep per night, every night.</p>\n<p>Of course, <strong>you can skip the routine on Friday or Saturday</strong>, because we want to party from time to time, right? Make sure you don’t exceed the 1 time per week limit. Everything in balance.</p>\n<p>I found this routine extremely helpful and efficient for me. You can try it and experiment with your body if you like. The goal was to share my experience and knowledge with you and eliminate the noise from the fitness industry.</p>\n<h1>Expectations</h1>\n<p>We all dream of being like superheroes (Thor, Captain America, Superman, Batman, etc.) or like our favorite Instagram influencer.

I left some useful links as you can see.\r\n\r\nI watched YouTube videos and followed the course above and there is a lot of information that overwelled me. After 3 years of trial and error, I finally found a minimalistic chart layout and trading strategy that brought me consistent rewards.\r\n\r\nI backtested this layout and strategy on multiple markets (individual stocks, ETFs, commodities, crypto, forex) and I always got an average win to loss ratio of 2. This means I had at least 2x more wins compared to losses.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the tools, we first need to make some considerations:\r\n\r\n## 1-Day Heikin Ashi Chart\r\n\r\nWe will always use the 1D Heikin Ashi chart. We will never bother checking 1-Hour or 1-Minute charts, nor regular candlestick charts as they are filled with noise and they are hard to interpret.\r\n\r\nI found the 1D Heikin Ashi chart is the most accurate and granular at the same time trading chart.\r\n\r\n> Buy: green Heikin Ashi candle without a bottom wick\r\n\r\n> Sell: red Heikin Ashi candle without a top wick\r\n\r\n## Short/Medium-Term investing\r\n\r\nWe will focus on short/medium-term investing because we will see corrections along the way. For instance, although we are in a bull market, we may see a downtrend last for a month. It is crucial to be patient and stick to the plan during these times.\r\n\r\n## Fundamental analysis\r\n\r\nFundamental analysis (e.g. cash flow, news, hype, underlying value) will always beat technical analysis. This is why before investing, we also understand the underlying value of the asset if any.\r\n\r\nWe also try to understand the market cycles, read the weekly news, and analyze the current economic status.\r\n\r\n## Probabilities\r\n\r\nWhen using technical analysis, we are using probabilities, not something 100% accurate.\r\n\r\n> There is and will never be a technical analysis indicator or combination of indicators that will indicate a 100% successful trade.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to achieve is a higher probability that our trade (long or short) will be successful.\r\n\r\nNow that we cleared this up, let’s see the technical indicators.\r\n\r\n# The 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\nThe 20, 50, and 200 EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) are the top indicators to determine the long-term trend: bullish or bearish. If we don’t know the trend, we can’t know if it’s the time to buy or sell.\r\n\r\n> Bull trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross above the 200 EMA\r\n\r\n> Bear trend: the 20 and 50 period EMAs cross below the 200 EMA\r\n\r\nNow that we have this information, let’s see how to apply it. Knowledge is not power until applied.\r\n\r\n## Enter signals\r\n\r\nWe enter long only after the 50-period EMA crossed above the 200-period EMA, and after the 20-period EMA crossed above the 50-period EMA.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to wait and see that we have at least 2 ascending green candlesticks, without bottom wick, and above the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\nFor short signals, the same algorithm, but reversed: 50-period EMA crossed below the 200-period EMA, the 20-period EMA crossed below the 50-period EMA, at least 2 descending red candlesticks, without top wick, and below the 20-period EMA.\r\n\r\n## Exit signals\r\n\r\nWe exit a long entry when a red candlestick closes below the 200-period EMA. In analogy, we exit a short entry when a green candlestick closes above the 200-period EMA.\r\n\r\nLet’s see some examples:\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*IMhh-sdChcl6n2Jhrar4ig.png)\r\n\r\nBTCUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*w5-lQNuo8YCpVr1JPSKKBw.png)\r\n\r\nAAPL 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*OGUc9YG2gdr9MOtutZCVeA.png)\r\n\r\nQQQ 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1NxHAMyMs-EUOMOTrg36tQ.png)\r\n\r\nVOO 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*h0Gpj4ifIUK8n-1DMXV13Q.png)\r\n\r\nGOLD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Exk9-6IK9GpGzVH8WO6KlA.png)\r\n\r\nEURUSD 1D Heikin Ashi in Trading View with 20/50/200 EMAs\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I chose different assets just to prove to you that the strategy applies to different markets: stocks, ETFs, crypto, forex, and commodities. The assets were chosen randomly, so I don’t invite you to invest in any of them.\r\n\r\nIn every screenshot, I included the average winning to losing trades ratio so you can see we have more than 2 times more winning compared to losing trades (ratio > 2).\r\n\r\n> Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser and don’t recommend investing in anything as nothing is guaranteed.

Stay with me as our posts are always short and concise.\r\n\r\nThere are many magic pills spread around the web that guarantee easy and rapid fat loss. I am sorry for disappointing you, but if you are looking for the easy and fast solution, you are going to crash and burn.\r\n\r\n**Fat loss is all about human physiology.** If you understand the basics (like everything in life) you will no longer waste your time, money, and energy on useless crap.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the human body is an amazingly complex machine that is influenced by the environment, so it's impossible to track everything; we can't be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut let's focus on what we can control, okay?\r\n\r\n2 major factors impact fat loss:\r\n\r\n# Energy deficit\r\n\r\nOf course, I am talking about calories. This is the golden rule, you cannot eat anything as much as you can without getting fat, regardless of how healthy it is.\r\n\r\n# Hormones\r\n\r\nHormones are, basically, chemical messengers that help our cells communicate with each other. Hormones dictate our state, how we feel, okay? This includes hunger.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule for permanent and smart fat loss is a combination of the two factors above:\r\n\r\n**Maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.**\r\n\r\nMake sure you remember this: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.\r\n\r\nThis is where all diets fail. They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.\r\n\r\nThe secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.\r\n\r\nThese foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.\r\n\r\nI will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.\r\n\r\nFor fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.\r\n\r\nMovement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.\r\n\r\n**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**\r\n\r\nSleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep, our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.\r\n\r\nAlso, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or/and fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe ideal sleeping time is from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m., but we cannot all follow that schedule. Thus, I suggest going to bed and waking up every day at the same time and make sure you sleep 7-9 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can also try some of these [sleeping hacks](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/sleeping-hacks).\r\n\r\nNow we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?\r\n\r\nTo tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.\r\n\r\nInsulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.\r\n\r\nRemember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**\r\n\r\nThe question is now: when is insulin in the blood?\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.\r\n\r\nThere has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**\r\n\r\nThis is why diets low in carbohydrates (e.g. Keto) and intermittent fasting are so effective for fat loss. I prefer intermittent fasting as it is easier to maintain and it also offers many health benefits.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water. This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy.\r\n\r\nYou can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;\r\n - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;\r\n - **Stay active** throughout the day;\r\n - Have a **regular sleep schedule**, ideally from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m.;\r\n - Go **low carb** or try **intermittent fasting**.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [Do Calories Matter?

Muscle building is all about science.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Anatomy and Physiology\r\n**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.\r\nOnly one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**\r\n\r\nThere are three types of muscle fibers:\r\n- **Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\r\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\r\n\r\nThe size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).\r\n\r\nThe primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.\r\n\r\nThe **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:\r\n- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);\r\n- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);\r\n- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nATP replenishment times:\r\n- 20 sec - 50.00 %;\r\n- 40 sec - 75.00 %;\r\n- 1 min - 87.50 %;\r\n- 80 sec - 93.75 %;\r\n- 100 sec - 96.88 %;\r\n- 2 mins - 98.44 %;\r\n- 140 sec - 99.22 %;\r\n- 160 sec - 99.61 %;\r\n- 3 min - 99.81 %.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)\r\nThere are two types of hypertrophy:\r\n- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;\r\n- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\r\n\r\nSarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).\r\n\r\n**_Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time._**\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called **satellite cells** become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\nHormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:\r\n- **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);**\r\n- **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);**\r\n- **Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);**\r\n- **Growth hormone (GH);**\r\n- **Testosterone.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\r\n\r\n# Efficient, targeted strength training\r\nIf our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let's see:\r\n\r\n|Fiber type|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I|+15|70%|2 - 0 - 1|\r\n|Type IIA|6-12|75-85%|4 - 0 - 3|\r\n|Type IIB|1-3|+90%|3 - 1 - 1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nGeekier:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Rep range|%1rep-max(1RM)|Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Type I sarcomere hypertrophy|15-50|<70%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|>50|<50%|2-0-1|\r\n|Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy|6-15|70-85%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|12-25|50-70%|4-0-3|\r\n|Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy|3-5|85-95%|3-1-1|\r\n|Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy|6-12|70-85%|3-1-1|\r\n|Absolute strength|1-2|>90%|3-1-1|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|Training goal|Sets|Reps per set|%1rep-max(1RM)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n|Maximum muscle size|3|6-12|75-85%|\r\n|Maximum strength|3-7|1-5|>85%|\r\n|Combined muscle and strength|3|3-12|75-90%|\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBe careful to **perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.** Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.\r\n\r\n# Best strength training exercises\r\nThe best strength training exercises are unquestionably the **free weight compound movements:**\r\n- **Squats;**\r\n- **Deadlifts;**\r\n- **Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;**\r\n- **Parallel Dips;**\r\n- **Bent Over Rows**\r\n- **Pull-ups / Chin-Ups**\r\n- **Military Presses**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.\r\n\r\nConstantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.\r\n  \r\n# Training frequency\r\nThe muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must **train each muscle group 2-3 times per week**. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.\r\n\r\nFor busy people who don't have much time to spend in the gym, **three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough**. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.\r\n\r\nSmall-boned characteristics:\r\n- Wrist circumferences <10.5% of the height;\r\n- Ankle circumferences <13.0% of the height.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body's systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.\r\n\r\nIdeally, **a rest day should follow each training day.**\r\n\r\nMuscle fatigue is caused by:\r\n- Lactic acid accumulation;\r\n- ATP shortage;\r\n- PC shortage;\r\n- Inorganic phosphate accumulation;\r\n- Peripheral nervous system fatigue;\r\n- Central nervous system fatigue.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe **training session should be for 45-75 minutes**.\r\n\r\n# Diet\r\nFor building muscle, we need **minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,** and **10% caloric surplus**. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.\r\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:\r\n- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);\r\n- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;\r\n- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);\r\n- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\r\n\r\n# Other lifestyle factors\r\nOf course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.\r\n\r\nSleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nMake sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.\r\n\r\n**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n- train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;\r\n- focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;\r\n- execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;\r\n- for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;\r\n- for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in >85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;\r\n- for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;\r\n- constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;\r\n- rest ~2 minutes between sets;\r\n- train for 45-75 minutes;\r\n- ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;\r\n- whole good quality food;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;\r\n- min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;\r\n- scheduled good quality sleep;\r\n- 2-6L water per day;\r\n- relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle1.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle2.html);\r\n - [The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle3.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth1.html);\r\n - [Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?](http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth2.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part I: Exercise Selection](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/selection.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/sequence.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/reps.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part IV: Training Frequency](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/frequency.html);\r\n - [Making A Strength/Size Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/split.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](http://www.weightrainer.net/training/rules.html);\r\n - [The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee](https://youtu.be/agUmfvM4rjw);\r\n - [The Truth About Rep Ranges & Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High](https://youtu.be/yLR9rfuE6Sg).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n",html:'<p>It\'s time to eliminate the fitness industry bullshit and get old-school.

A motor neuron and its fibers are called a <strong>motor unit.</strong></p>\n<p>There are three types of muscle fibers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\n<p>The size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).</p>\n<p>The primary energy currency for all cells is <strong>Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mitochondria</strong> are responsible for producing ATP via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phosphagen system</strong> (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);</li>\n<li><strong>Anaerobic glycolysis</strong> (anaerobic);</li>\n<li><strong>Oxidative phosphorylation</strong> (aerobic) - Kreb\'s cycle and electron transport chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>ATP replenishment times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 sec - 50.00 %;</li>\n<li>40 sec - 75.00 %;</li>\n<li>1 min - 87.50 %;</li>\n<li>80 sec - 93.75 %;</li>\n<li>100 sec - 96.88 %;</li>\n<li>2 mins - 98.44 %;</li>\n<li>140 sec - 99.22 %;</li>\n<li>160 sec - 99.61 %;</li>\n<li>3 min - 99.81 %.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)</h1>\n<p>There are two types of hypertrophy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</strong>;</li>\n<li><strong>Sarcomere hypertrophy</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive. Thus, more mitochondria, more enzymes, more ATP, and more endurance (mostly type I fibers).\n<p>Sarcomere hypertrophy is an increase in the volume of contractile machinery - the highest potential for increasing muscle cell size and strength (mostly type II fibers).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Muscle fiber development occurs as a result of cellular damage or trauma (stress) caused by sufficient tension for sufficient time given the adequate nutrients and the adequate recovery time.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When this happens, stem cells around the muscle cells called <strong>satellite cells</strong> become similar to muscle cells and donate their nuclei to the muscle fibers.</p>\n<p>Hormones and growth factors are also produced as a result of cell damage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Transforming Growth Factor -Beta Superfamily (TGF-beta);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Growth hormone (GH);</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Testosterone.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThe muscle fiber repair and growth lasts for several hours to several days, depending on the stress level.\n<h1>Efficient, targeted strength training</h1>\n<p>If our goals are to build muscle or/and strength, we need to lift heavy enough (tension ) and for adequate time. But what is sufficient and enough? Let\'s see:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fiber type</th>\n<th>Rep range</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n<th>Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>70%</td>\n<td>2 - 0 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>75-85%</td>\n<td>4 - 0 - 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB</td>\n<td>1-3</td>\n<td>+90%</td>\n<td>3 - 1 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\nGeekier:\n<br>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Training goal</th>\n<th>Rep range</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n<th>Rep cadence (Eccentric-Isometric-Concentric)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>15-50</td>\n<td>&lt;70%</td>\n<td>2-0-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type I sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>&gt;50</td>\n<td>&lt;50%</td>\n<td>2-0-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>6-15</td>\n<td>70-85%</td>\n<td>4-0-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIA sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>12-25</td>\n<td>50-70%</td>\n<td>4-0-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB sarcomere hypertrophy</td>\n<td>3-5</td>\n<td>85-95%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type IIB sarcoplasmic hypertrophy</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>70-85%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Absolute strength</td>\n<td>1-2</td>\n<td>&gt;90%</td>\n<td>3-1-1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\nBriefly:\n<br>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Training goal</th>\n<th>Sets</th>\n<th>Reps per set</th>\n<th>%1rep-max(1RM)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum muscle size</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6-12</td>\n<td>75-85%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum strength</td>\n<td>3-7</td>\n<td>1-5</td>\n<td>&gt;85%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Combined muscle and strength</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3-12</td>\n<td>75-90%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Be careful to <strong>perform each repetition with proper form, no cheating, or ego lifting.</strong> Start with weights that you feel most confident you can perform 12-15 reps for the first set and increase from there.</p>\n<h1>Best strength training exercises</h1>\n<p>The best strength training exercises are unquestionably the <strong>free weight compound movements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Squats;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Deadlifts;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bench Presses / Weighted Push-ups;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Parallel Dips;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bent Over Rows</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pull-ups / Chin-Ups</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Military Presses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThese should be the cornerstone of our training routine. You should add isolation exercises only you lack strength or size in specific muscle group areas.\n<p>Try to avoid training to failure when training for strength to prevent nervous system burnout.</p>\n<p>Constantly progress or change the workout routines, because the body adapts. Constantly change the exercises and increase intensity/weights when you feel you reached a plateau.</p>\n<h1>Training frequency</h1>\n<p>The muscle fibers need time to recover for efficient development. The recovery process and anabolic period last for 48-72 hours. For this reason, we must <strong>train each muscle group 2-3 times per week</strong>. How we accomplish this depends on the schedule of each individual and genetics.</p>\n<p>For busy people who don\'t have much time to spend in the gym, <strong>three weekly full-body training sessions based on compound exercises is enough</strong>. This program also applies to small-boned/small-jointed people.</p>\n<p>Small-boned characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrist circumferences &lt;10.5% of the height;</li>\n<li>Ankle circumferences &lt;13.0% of the height.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf you are not a fan of full-body training, you can experiment with different splits out there and see which one suits you.\n<p>Keep in mind that regardless of the muscle group your training, all the body\'s systems are affected: glycogen, enzymes, ATP, CP, etc. Thus, the muscles may recover, but the other systems may still be fatigued.</p>\n<p>Ideally, <strong>a rest day should follow each training day.</strong></p>\n<p>Muscle fatigue is caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lactic acid accumulation;</li>\n<li>ATP shortage;</li>\n<li>PC shortage;</li>\n<li>Inorganic phosphate accumulation;</li>\n<li>Peripheral nervous system fatigue;</li>\n<li>Central nervous system fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>The <strong>training session should be for 45-75 minutes</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Diet</h1>\n<p>For building muscle, we need <strong>minimum 2g/kg of body weight of (complete) protein per day, minimum 1g/kg of body weight of dietary fat per day,</strong> and <strong>10% caloric surplus</strong>. Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) <strong>whole foods</strong> and not fitness supplements.\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good quality <strong>Complete protein powder</strong> (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);</li>\n<li><strong>Creatine monohydrate</strong> or complex;</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex</strong> (extracted from natural food sources);</li>\n<li><strong>Krill Oil</strong> (Omega-3s).</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\n<h1>Other lifestyle factors</h1>\n<p>Of course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. <strong>Sleep</strong> is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.</p>\n<p>Sleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between <strong>10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.</strong>, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to <strong>go to sleep and wake up at the same hours</strong> every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.</p>\n<p>Make sure to <strong>stay hydrated</strong>. We need <strong>2-6L of water per day</strong>, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic stress</strong> is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant. Massage is also a good idea.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>This is what you should get from this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>train each muscle group 2-3 times per week;</li>\n<li>focus on compound exercises and limit isolation exercises;</li>\n<li>execute each repetition with good form and avoid ego lifting;</li>\n<li>for muscle volume, 3 sets of 6-12 reps in 75-85% RM with 2-0-1 cadence;</li>\n<li>for strength, 3-7 sets of 1-5 reps in &gt;85% RM with 3-1-1 cadence;</li>\n<li>for combined muscle and strength, 3 sets of 3-12 reps in 75-90% RM with 4-1-3 cadence;</li>\n<li>constantly increase the intensity and variate each exercise to avoid plateau;</li>\n<li>rest ~2 minutes between sets;</li>\n<li>train for 45-75 minutes;</li>\n<li>ideally, rest day after every training day for full system recovery;</li>\n<li>whole good quality food;</li>\n<li>min 1g/kg/day of complete protein;</li>\n<li>min 1g/kg/day of dietary fat;</li>\n<li>scheduled good quality sleep;</li>\n<li>2-6L water per day;</li>\n<li>relaxation (deep breathing, massage, meditation, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Follow the white rabbit</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle1.html">The Neuromuscular System Part I: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle2.html">The Neuromuscular System Part II: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/muscle3.html">The Neuromuscular System Part III: What A Weight Trainer Needs To Know About Muscle</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth1.html">Muscle Growth Part I: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/physiology/growth2.html">Muscle Growth Part II: Why, And How, Does A Muscle Grow And Get Stronger?</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/selection.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part I: Exercise Selection</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/sequence.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part II: Exercise Sequence</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/reps.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part III: Sets And Reps And How To Perform Them</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/frequency.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part IV: Training Frequency</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/split.html">Making A Strength/Size Routine Part V: Splitting Your Routine</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.weightrainer.net/training/rules.html">The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="https://youtu.be/agUmfvM4rjw">The Rules of Productive Weight Training for The Drug-Free Trainee</a>;</li>\n<li><a href="https://youtu.be/yLR9rfuE6Sg">The Truth About Rep Ranges &amp; Building Muscle | Low vs Moderate vs High</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n',attributes:{author:"Razvan Tomegea",title:"The Ultimate Simplified Guide to Building Muscle",id:"the-ultimate-simplified-guide-to-building-muscle",createdOn:"Aug 28, 2019",categories:"Fitness",description:"It is time to eliminate the fitness industry bullshit and get old-school.

We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.\r\n\r\n-   the economy is about to crash;\r\n-   people die and are sick all around the planet;\r\n-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;\r\n-   some of us are unemployed;\r\n-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.\r\n\r\n# 1. Health is the most critical asset\r\n\r\nI learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.\r\n\r\nIt is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.\r\n\r\nTake care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**\r\n\r\nWe are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. \r\n\r\nAll I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.\r\n\r\nOur immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.\r\n\r\nYou see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:\r\n\r\n-   avoid closed and public areas;\r\n-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;\r\n-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;\r\n-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;\r\n-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);\r\n-   limit alcohol and smoking;\r\n-   eat real food and limit processed food;\r\n-   drink plenty of water;\r\n-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);\r\n-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;\r\n-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.\r\n\r\n# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it\r\n\r\nThere was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.\r\n\r\n**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**\r\n\r\nMy advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.\r\n\r\n# 3. Be prepared for anything\r\n\r\nI am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.\r\n\r\n-   I invested in a minimal home gym;\r\n-   I take cold showers;\r\n-   I spend most time alone;\r\n-   I work remotely;\r\n-   I cook and prepare my food;\r\n-   I live a healthy lifestyle;\r\n-   I don't depend on my parents.\r\n\r\nI am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.\r\n\r\nLife is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.\r\n\r\n# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.\r\n\r\nWe need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.\r\n\r\nYou may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.\r\n\r\n**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**\r\n\r\nLife will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\n**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.\r\n\r\nNow, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.\r\n\r\n**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**\r\n\r\n# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true\r\n\r\nEverybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.\r\n\r\n**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**\r\n\r\nJust ask, \"why?\". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.\r\n\r\n**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.\r\n\r\nReporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.\r\n\r\n**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",html:"<p>There is no questioning that this year (2020) is a challenging year for humanity.

It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it. You are making me feel bad,\" then this is not how a man reacts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you can say is: \"Yeah! I am like a pig. Be a good girl and scratch my belly from time to time, won't you?\" and laugh about it. You can also say: \"I don't know. I kind of look sexy with this belly.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGot the idea? The idea is: **don't take her seriously**. Always be prepared to make a laugh of her complaints towards you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBe careful, though. There are times when you must take her seriously. If she tells you not to stop leaving your underwear on the floor, then you have to listen to her. In this case, you can make fun of yourself by smiling and saying: \"Oh man. My bad. I forgot to tell you that we have a pig in the house. I will go and put him back in his cage.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, you make fun of your mistakes, but still, you will keep in mind to improve. You also made each other laugh about the issue.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe point is, **don't be intimidated by her and don't make her your queen**. She is your woman, and you are her man.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nWe men are rational beings. We always try to find patterns and some sense in everything. Women, however, are emotional beings.

For what is worth, I think most of them are bullshit.\n\nI am also talking about spot reduction. Does any of the ads: “10-minute Ab Workout To Melt Belly Fat” or “Best Exercises For Thin Legs” ring a bell? Trust me; spot reduction is a myth.\n\nThe body decides based on hormones and genetics where to store and from where to burn fat. It’s out of our control.\n\nThe only thing we can do is manage our calories and ensure we burn more than we consume — or consume less than we burn.\n\nWe will analyze the most popular exercise routines and see which burns the most calories (fat).\n\n# Strength training\n\nI am sorry to break your bubble, but strength training burns the least amount of calories. Strength training is not for burning fat necessarily, but for improving body composition by increasing contractile tissue.\n\nDepending on your body weight, age, and gender, you may burn around (+/- 100kcal) 300 kcal per hour of strength training. We are excluding any form of cardio from this.\n\nAlso, during that hour of training, we are doing it intensely with a maximum of 1–2 minutes rest between sets and reps (on the timer).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*TcIKZFBwB-mQaJvpTGCZ4Q.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training](https://bodily.app/)\n\nStrength training is a high-intensity interval training regimen and cannot be maintained for long periods. It has a high impact on the nervous system, muscular system, and cardiovascular system.\n\nIf someone works out for more than one and a half hours, he’s either wasting time, either doing some cardio, either is on PEDs.\n\nAccording to our human physiology, this form of exercise relies on glycogen and blood glucose for energy. Body fat is almost untouched during the session.\n\nAlso, building more muscle will increase your resting metabolic rate, which means you will burn more calories doing nothing. It’s kind of an investment.\n\nCombine this knowledge with the fact that strength training burns few calories, for sure strength training is not for fat loss, but muscle building and general health and wellbeing.\n\n# Running\n\nRunning is medium to high intensity aerobic exercise, depending on the pace. This type of exercise burn the most amount of energy per hour, some of it (25%) coming from body fat during the session.\n\nIt is for this reasons why most people choose running for fat loss. Aerobic exercise relies mostly on body fat for energy and it also burns a lot of calories.\n\nRunning for one hour at 8 miles per hour (12 km/h) burns around 1000 kcal (+/- 200 kcal). It is 3 times more than strength training. Even running for 30 minutes burns more than strength training.\n\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EolPGk2S9_Zt1X_ah9kzqQ.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running](https://bodily.app/)\n\nHowever, running alone for long periods of times may also burn muscle mass as it is catabolic and doesn’t stimulate muscle growth. If you don’t believe me, look at all the runners (not sprinters) out there and decide for yourself.\n\nRunning is also taxing your cardiovascular and nervous system and cannot be performed daily. I found running fun from time to time, but cannot do it more than once or twice per week.\n\nIn conclusion, running burns the most amount of calories, improves the cardiovascular system, but cannot be done often.\n\n# Walking\n\nWalking is my favorite form of exercise. I wrote an article about walking [here](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/why-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4). I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.\n\nI like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.\n\nWalking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+/- 100 kcal).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png)\n\n[Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking](https://bodily.app/)\n\nIt is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.\n\nWith all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.\n\n-   strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;\n-   running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;\n-   walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.\n\nThe winner is walking because of the consistency. Slow, long-term consistent progress will always beat fat, short-term progress.\n\nHowever, walking does not improves any muscle, neither skeletal, nor cardiovascular. Make no mistake, strength training and running may not burn more calories, but they do offer more health and fitness benefits than walking.\n\nIn my opinion, all three forms of exercise must be incorporated and combined in ones lifestyle for health and fitness purposes.\n\nI do include them, however I must work on my running (medium intensity aerobic exercise) routine, as I skip it because it makes me very tired.\n\n**What are your favorite exercises?

I wrote an article about walking <a href="https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/why-walking-is-the-best-exercise-you-should-be-doing-everyday-8b359e1d93c4">here</a>. I love it because of its many benefits, even for fat loss. For starters, walking relies almost entirely on body fat as energy source.</p>\n<p>I like walking because it is an active form of recovery, it helps me unwind, it gives me energy, it burns calories, and it can be done anywhere and anytime.</p>\n<p>Walking burns the same amount of calories as a gym session. One hour of brisk walking burns around 300 kcal (+/- 100 kcal).</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CgF-9__PbGwD8y6VqPXkVg.png" alt=""></p>\n<p><a href="https://bodily.app/">Bodily.app exercise tracking. 1-hour weight training vs running vs walking</a></p>\n<p>It is the most versatile exercise and it is what we (humans) evolved to perform daily. Yes, daily. We can walk daily and don’t need to recover like the other exercises. Also, we don’t need equipment and high fitness level.</p>\n<p>With all of this being said, let’s draw the line at the end of the week which exercise burns most calories, because that’s what matters in the end.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>strength training 3 hours per week: 1000 kcal;</li>\n<li>running 2 hours per week: 2000 kcal;</li>\n<li>walking 7 hours per week: 2100 kcal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The winner is walking because of the consistency.

I started taking long walks in high school with my headphones on and discovered its relaxing benefits on my mind. Ever since I rarely let da day pass without walking just a little bit. It is a part of me.\r\n\r\nIt is not just me but many research studies. I am not quoting any because I guarantee you won’t find a study that says: “Walking is bad for you.” All scientific studies support my hypothesis that walking is beneficial for us.\r\n\r\nWalking is a blessing, and I’ve always feared the day I could no longer walk because of age or illness. It is the reason I take care of my body so much: to reach old age and to be able to take care of myself and, at least, still walk.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a spinal cord tumor and can no longer walk easily, just a few steps. Even so, she still makes the time to go out and make a few steps around the neighborhood because she felt the benefits.\r\n\r\nNow, without further ado, let’s look at the benefits of walking that make it the best form of exercise.\r\n\r\n## Can Be Done By Anyone Anywhere Anytime\r\n\r\nYou don’t need special equipment. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a tracksuit, jeans, tuxedo, or dress; you can walk.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if it is sunny, raining, or snowing; you can grab an umbrella and go for a walk.\r\n\r\nIf you’re traveling, again, I recommend you visit by walking as you have the opportunity to see more than just going from destination to destination with a car. Of course, it doesn’t apply if the locations are tens of kilometers apart.\r\n\r\n## No Fitness Level Needed\r\n\r\nIf you learned to walk, then you can walk regardless of age, gender, race, profession, weight, and fitness level. If you have two legs and can use them, you can walk.\r\n\r\nIf you have been sedentary and plan on starting a new exercise routine, walking is the first step. It is a mistake to go to the gym or run in the park before you can’t go for a long walk.\r\n\r\nIf you can walk at least 6km at once, don’t even think about doing something more intense.\r\n\r\n## Helps You Relax\r\n\r\nFor me, whenever I go for a walk, I relax and get my mind right. I sometimes go with a friend or my girlfriend and chat. Most of the time, I call my grandmother to see how she’s doing.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to an audiobook or your favorite music; it doesn’t matter. You can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nWalking is also a great way to recover from intense exercise.\r\n\r\n## Good Form Of Cardio\r\n\r\nCardio is short for cardiovascular exercise, aka aerobic exercise. Cardio is useful for improving the heart and lungs, as they are also muscles. I found that running exhausts me too much, and it’s hard for me to recover.\r\n\r\nWalking, however, not only helps me recover from intense exercise but also improves my cardiovascular strength. It is enough to increase your walking speed and heart rate to 130bpm, and you’re approximately in the aerobic zone.\r\n\r\nI found that after just taking 12–15km walks for months, I can also run 20–30 minutes (4–6km) without puking my lungs out.\r\n\r\nWalking is also safer for the joints.\r\n\r\n## Fat Burning\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why walking is the best way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that walking burns a lot of calories. One hour of relatively brisk walking burns more calories than 1 hour of strength training at the gym.\r\n\r\nThe second one is that the most fat is burned in an aerobic state (environment).\r\n\r\nAccording to [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J. Thompson (Author), Melinda Manore (Author), Linda Vaughan (Author)](https://www.amazon.com/The-Science-of-Nutrition/dp/0134898672), we burn 65% energy from fat during low-impact aerobic exercise, like walking.\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*8o__c6Ag7HXFpALmWCDY9A.png)\r\n\r\nSource: [“The Science Of Nutrition” by Janice J.
