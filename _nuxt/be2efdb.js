This article and blog are purely educational and informational._\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe live dark times, that's for sure because you know what. The biggest issue is confusion and helplessness. We do not know what to do to defend ourselves until a suitable vaccine appears, which is probably next spring or summer.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOur only bet is on our immune system. It is our defense system against any virus, bacteria, fungi, and any pathogen, and the new virus is not an exception. Our immune system, if strong enough, can defend us from the new microscopic enemy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrankly, even when vaccinated, our immune system is the one that does the job of protecting us because the vaccine is nothing else than a genetic sample of a virus or bacteria. The immune system sees it and generates antibodies (soldiers) for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntil the vaccine, our job is to increase our immune system as much as possible. We need to do this anyway for anything that will occur. Rest assured, this virus is not the last we will see.\r\n\r\n# Fresh air\r\n\r\nWe need fresh air to purify ourselves. **We live most of our lives in boxes**: we sleep in a box, eat from a box, go to work and school in a box, look at a box, and, finally, die in a box. How much time per week do you spend outside, not to mention in nature?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe some of you don't have the privilege to have some parks or forests near you, or you are too busy, and I get it. However, must of you are just lazy, and you are in denial. If not, **open the damn windows** and let the air come in. Don't incubate yourselves like sardines in a can.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStaying indoors, together with other 100-1000 people, is unhealthy. It is the perfect place for viruses and bacteria to grow. I hate staying indoors with a lot of people. I feel I cannot breathe. Maybe I am claustrophobic; who knows?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**I go for 1-2 hour walks outside every single day**. If I don't, for some reason, I feel I am dying. I feel like I did something wrong on that day. I am frustrated and irritable and depressed. My girlfriend can confirm that. I told her that if you want to kill me, make me sit and do nothing.\r\n\r\n# Vitamin D3\r\n\r\nAnother reason to go outside in the sun is Vitamin D3. We get Vitamin D3 from the sun, and only from the sun. We don't get it from food. Vitamin D from food is usually Vitamin D2, which is not the same.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVitamin d3 is **essential for our immunity, bones, hormones, and serotonin** (the neurotransmitter that makes us happy).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, there were commercials with Danonino yogurt for children. They said it contained calcium and Vitamin D to make kids grow and make their bones strong. I agree with them on the part that calcium needs Vitamin D3 to be absorbed and directed to the bones. However, I don't agree to give kids Danonino, yogurt filled with sugar and synthetic ingredient.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to the sun, because of geolocation or season, take a Vitamin D3 supplement. Just make sure you take 5000 IU per day. However, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any over the counter supplement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Vitamin D, check [Dr. Mercola's website](https://vitamind.mercola.com/).\r\n\r\n# (Less) Hygiene\r\n\r\nDisinfect your hands, shoes, car, clothes, doors, dog, cat, rat, pig, bird, kid, grandma, neighbor; disinfect everything you can. That's what they keep on saying everywhere we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHippocrates said: \"Everything in excess is opposed to nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho was Hippocrates? Well, just a physician from ancient Greece who is now known as the father of medicine. What did he know, right?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is also a saying: \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExcess hygiene and sanitation do more harm than good, for a simple reason: they **disrupt our microbiome.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**We live in symbiosis with trillions of bacteria** within and without our bodies. These bacteria are both beneficial and non-beneficial, but the ratio is important. If the proportion of beneficial bacterial to harmful bacteria is higher, we are healthier, unhealthier otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen sanitize and clean ourselves so excessively as nowadays, we kill everything on our body, both good and bad. Everywhere you go, you see antibacterial disinfectant or antibiotic. For your information, **antibacterial does not mean antiviral**, which is our main focus now. Also, antibiotic kills life and, last time I checked, a virus is not alive, just a protein or genetic material.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAmong other benefits, our **microbiome is essential in developing antibodies**. Thus, when we excessively sanitize, we lower our immunity. Most harmed are our children. Their microbiome is still in development, and the only way to develop it is by being exposed to bacteria from the environment.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I and others of my age or older were kids, we ate with our dirty hands and spent time in dirt as much as possible. Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is enough to **use regular soap** to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check [this](https://en.unesco.org/news/how-soap-kills-covid-19-hands) and [this](https://www.uchealth.org/today/why-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus/)). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYour body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you're tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.\r\n\r\n# Healthy food\r\n\r\nWe are what we eat, that's for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won't grow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure you make your diet based on **vegetables and fruits**. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you're not vegan or vegetarian, **lean meats** are great. If you tolerate **eggs and fish,** Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nSleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExercise **increases blood flow and oxygenation**, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.\r\n\r\n# Stress management\r\n\r\n(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because **chronic stress lowers our immune system**.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFind ways to relax as much as you can. For me, **exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep** do miracles.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nForce yourself to **smile and be optimistic**. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.\r\n\r\n# Cold showers\r\n\r\nI have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. **I feel warm all the time** because my circulation is improved.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. **Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.\r\n\r\n# Medicinal mushrooms\r\n\r\nNo, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest **medicinal mushrooms may** [**improve immunity**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520706/)**, may have** [**antioxidant properties**](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6995766) **and may** [**fight cancer**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504783/)**.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe most popular medicinal mushroom is **Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)**. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.\r\n\r\n# Turmeric and Ginger\r\n\r\nTurmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ginger), and [this](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGinger and turmeric may have **anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**, which in turn boost the immune system. Again, do your research and consult with a professional before trying any herb and supplement.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

Also, keep in mind that bacteria and viruses exist before humanity existed, and not something invented in the last century.</p>\n<p>It is enough to <strong>use regular soap</strong> to stay healthy and clean. It is even more effective than alcohol (check <a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/how-soap-kills-covid-19-hands">this</a> and <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/why-soap-and-water-work-better-than-hand-sanitizer-to-remove-the-coronavirus/">this</a>). If people were to use soap and water to clean themselves, they would have prevented the black death.</p>\n<h1>Sleep</h1>\n<p>Sleep cures almost anything, and the lack of it causes everything. Sleeping is anabolic and helps our body grow and recover. It is why children sleep 10-12 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Make sure you sleep enough. How much is enough? It depends on your genetics. Some people can recover with 5-6 hours of sleep (like The Rock and Arnold Schwarzenegger), while others (like me) need 9 hours of sleep. People with 18+ years need 7-9 hours of sleep.</p>\n<p>Your body will inform you if you need more sleep. If you\'re tired, depressed, irritable, and prone to sickness, you need to sleep more.</p>\n<h1>Healthy food</h1>\n<p>We are what we eat, that\'s for sure. If we eat junk, we are junk. Our immune system needs essential nutrients, like amino acids and fatty acids, to develop. If we are deficient in any nutrient, we won\'t grow.</p>\n<p>Make sure you make your diet based on <strong>vegetables and fruits</strong>. No one will ever contradict that vegetables and fruits are not healthy. If you\'re not vegan or vegetarian, <strong>lean meats</strong> are great. If you tolerate <strong>eggs and fish,</strong> Atlantic fish, like sardines, mackerel, or herring, are superfoods.</p>\n<h1>Exercise</h1>\n<p>Sleep, food, and exercise. These three components are fundamental to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle will improve your immunity. Pick any form of exercise you like and be consistent with it every day of your life.</p>\n<p>Exercise <strong>increases blood flow and oxygenation</strong>, which helps our cells receive good stuff and remove bad stuff faster.</p>\n<h1>Stress management</h1>\n<p>(Chronic) Stress is the root cause of many modern diseases. Chronic stress is excess stress, and, as anything in excess, it does a lot of harm.</p>\n<p>After a period of chronic stress, I feel my immunity lowering, and I get sick immediately. It is because <strong>chronic stress lowers our immune system</strong>.</p>\n<p>My grandmother developed a spinal cord tumor because of life-long stress and worrying.</p>\n<p>Stress is one of the root causes of many illnesses like heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and high blood cholesterol.</p>\n<p>Find ways to relax as much as you can. For me, <strong>exercise, walking in nature, listening to my favorite music, singing, and having a good sleep</strong> do miracles.</p>\n<p>Force yourself to <strong>smile and be optimistic</strong>. You will live longer and healthier as your immunity will skyrocket.</p>\n<h1>Cold showers</h1>\n<p>I have been taking cold showers almost every day for the past six years, and I feel the benefits. One of them is that I tolerate cold better. <strong>I feel warm all the time</strong> because my circulation is improved.</p>\n<p>In the past six years, I think I got sick mildly two or three times (just some coughing and sneezing).</p>\n<p>Many people fear acute cold like death, but any acute stress is beneficial. <strong>Russians keep their children outside in the cold winter to improve their immunity.</strong></p>\n<p>If you like only hot showers and baths, you need to make a change. Start decreasing the water temperature gradually until you reach the maximum cold.</p>\n<h1>Medicinal mushrooms</h1>\n<p>No, I am not talking about those mushrooms that make you high, but about medicinal mushrooms.</p>\n<p>Eastern Asia is known for the use of medicinal herbs for thousands of years, including medicinal mushrooms. Now, the research studies on medicinal mushrooms are not definitive, and many are contradictory. However, some suggest <strong>medicinal mushrooms may</strong> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520706/"><strong>improve immunity</strong></a><strong>, may have</strong> <a href="https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6995766"><strong>antioxidant properties</strong></a> <strong>and may</strong> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504783/"><strong>fight cancer</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>The most popular medicinal mushroom is <strong>Reishi (Ganoderma Lucidum)</strong>. Chinese have been using it for thousands of years for their health properties.</p>\n<p>I recommend doing your research and health consultation before taking any supplement, even over the counter ones. They may do more harm than good for you.</p>\n<h1>Turmeric and Ginger</h1>\n<p>Turmeric and ginger are part of the same family of roots. Indians have been using them for thousands of years. However, the research is still inconclusive (check <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ginger">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric">this</a>).</p>\n<p>Ginger and turmeric may have <strong>anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties</strong>, which in turn boost the immune system.

So many opinions and so much confusion. If you are reading this, I guess you are struggling with getting lean and staying lean.\r\n\r\nI've been fluctuating with my weight and body composition throughout my life in a visible manner. I've been experimenting with some diets and eating patterns, and I've found that only one trick worked. It's not just me, but the majority of people. It's the **law of physics** that will never be broken.\r\n\r\nDoes it require discipline? Yes! Is it simple? Yes! Is it easy? In the beginning, not at all. In the beginning, nothing is easy, but if you want to be lean, then you will do it.\r\n\r\n# Calorie deficit\r\n\r\nThe calorie deficit is the holy grail of body composition. Body fat, adipose tissue, is stored energy. Energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, just transformed.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with calories, **calories are a unit of measurement for energy**. Our bodies require energy to function every day. We use energy when we think, when we digest, when our heart pumps blood, when our organs do their jobs. Nothing can be achieved without energy.\r\n\r\nWe get the **energy from the food we consume**. Every food has some energy. If it's packaged, the food has a label and you can see some nutrition facts on the label. The first one, bolded is energy.\r\n\r\n**If we ingest more energy than we burn, that energy will be stored in our body somewhere, so we will gain weight**. If we burn more than we ingest, that energy will be released and used. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion.\r\n\r\n# How many calories do we need?\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's pretty hard, nearly **impossible to estimate 100% accurately how much we ingest and burn** throughout that day. This is why so many people say calorie counting is useless. It is not useless. Don't be discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily about tracking 100% accurate. It is more about **being mindful of everything you put in your mouth**. Trust me, you can lose fat without moving a finger if you're tracing your calories properly.\r\n\r\nYou just need to be approximately around your calorie goals. In the last 7 years, the only thing that worked for me to be lean and stay lean is calorie count and being in a calorie deficit. Ask any professional fitness coach or nutritionist and they will tell you the same.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have some metabolic or hormonal disorder. In these cases, your metabolism is in chaos, and may be hard to estimate your resting metabolic rate. If this is the case, you'll have to experiment with some daily calories on a weekly basis and see how your body changes and then adjust from there. The calorie equation still applies.\r\n\r\nI recommend you **use an app** to do this job, otherwise, it is overkill. You can use my app, [https://lifestyletrack.web.app/](https://lifestyletrack.web.app/). You can track your body composition, diet, and exercise habits. It will do all the calculations for you.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing you need is to **calculate your resting metabolic rate (RMR)**. This is the energy your body consumes when your sleeping or doing nothing. Usually, it is around 2000 kcal per day. This is why the professionals set 2000kcal as the average daily caloric requirements. It is not correct though. We are not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to **track your eating habits**. Everything that you eat and has calories, track it.\r\n\r\nLastly, track your **physical activities**. From housework to intense workouts.\r\n\r\nThe energy balance equation is this: **food - resting metabolic rate - physical activities**. Again, my application will do this for you.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lose fat, the energy balance equation must be **slightly less than 0 (max -10% of required)**. If you want to gain some healthy weight, the energy balance equation must be **slightly more than 0 (max +10% of required)**. For maintenance, **around 0**  **(+/-3% of required)**.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-   you need to track your calories if you want to change your body composition;\r\n-   if you want to lose fat, you need to be in a slight calorie deficit (10%);\r\n-   if you want to gain healthy weight, you need to be in a slight calorie surplus (10%);\r\n-   if you want to maintain, you need to be in calorie maintenance.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

You may think that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates have enough money, but they don't. These guys are at another level. They no longer see money as we do - spending potential. They see money as capital for investments. It is how they made their fortune.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there you have it. If you want to increase your wealth, start investing. Easy, right? Surely not. Investing requires some **financial education, some capital, and lots of patience**. A lot of us don't have these qualities, but we can earn them.\r\n\r\n# Financial education\r\n\r\nFinancial education teaches us about money and how to earn it smartly. I recommend reading **\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\"** written by Robert Kiyosaki and **\"The Richest Man In Babylon,\"** written by George Clason**.** The biggest lesson I learned from these books is the value of making money work for you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, we are taught in school to work for money, but these books teach us to make money work for us. It is how top Forbes successful people did it and continue to do it. It is straightforward for them, but not for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou must be asking now: how can I make money work for me if I don't have any? Shouldn't I work for money first to earn them? It depends on your character. Many **successful investors invest money which isn't theirs**. You can do it too if you have the guts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor example, you can borrow money, invest, make some profit, payback, and reinvest your profit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOthers start their own business and then invest, but this is still the same concept: **make money work for you.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first step is to educate yourself on finances. Learn everything you can about how money works. You can start with the two books mentioned above and with \"The Rich Dad Channel\" on Youtube.\r\n\r\n# Personal finance management\r\n\r\nIt is the point of this article and the first step in making money: cash-flow. Where does your money go? Do you buy more liabilities (cars, clothes, parties) than assets (real estate, commodities, businesses)? Do you save money every month, or do you spend mindlessly?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTaking **control of your finances is the first step in making money** work for you. If every month you remain with 0 and you depend on the next salary, then you are not doing something right. You are consuming too much. I advise you to lower your consumption or increase your income so that every month you **save at least 10% of your income.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSaving 10% every month is not that big a deal, but makes a big difference in the long run as you increase your capital. Having capital is the initial step in investing and making money work for you.\r\n\r\n# **Investments**\r\n\r\nNow that you have a capital, you must make it work for you. If you keep on **saving money without investing, it will depreciate** as inflation increases every year.

No, you can eat only from KFC and McDonald's and be fit; I don't recommend this, though. Losing fat is all about being in an [energy deficit](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/do-this-and-youll-lose-fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI know that during a year when I stopped tracking my calories and eat only healthy food, I gained 10 kg. **Eating for health and longevity is not equal to eating for fat loss**. It is why there is so much garbage fitness food out there that I am also consuming, like artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other chemicals. Yes, because being 100% healthy and 100% fit is not achievable for me at the same time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; there is garbage food everywhere. Everything is polluted and filled with chemicals and preservatives.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of so-called health foods that are calorie-dense (high calories per 100g). Let's see some common ones.\r\n\r\n# Cheese\r\n\r\nEverybody loves cheese, even people with lactose intolerance. I love cheese, but we need to learn to love what is good for us.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNow, there are many kinds of cheese, and I am not talking about low-fat cottage cheese, a great low-calorie, high-protein food. I am talking about the full-fat cheese, like cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick, and other matured high fat cheese.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThey are very healthy and delicious, as they contain beneficial bacteria (if from trusted sources). The issue is they have **300-400 kcal per 100g. It is a lot of calories**, compared to low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt, which contain 70-80 kcal per 100g.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I can never eat 50-100g of whole cheese. I eat 200-300g, which is 1000kcal. Thus, I avoid it and stick to low-fat dairy.\r\n\r\n# Coconut oil\r\n\r\nI used to put coconut oil in almost anything for its miracle benefits. They say it contains a lot of MCT oil, which is used directly for energy and not stored as fat. I was a fool to believe it. Any oil is stored as fat if it leads to a daily calorie surplus.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, coconut oil is a better alternative to plant-seed oils as it doesn't oxidize so quickly and easily. However, you still need to pay attention to the quantities, as it is **900kcal per 100g** (100% fat).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRegardless if you're using coconut oil or any oil, use a spray. I spray my pan when frying anything. Don't just pour from the bottle. If you don't have a cooking spray, use a teaspoon.\r\n\r\n# Peanut/Almond/Cashew butter\r\n\r\nI was addicted to peanut butter, and since the day I quit eating it, I started losing fat without thinking about it. **Peanut butter has, indeed, 26g of protein per 100g and lots of minerals, but it comes with a price of 550 kcal - if 100% peanuts**. There are kinds of peanut butter with only 50% peanuts, and the rest is palm oil. Those may reach 700kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found that a better version of peanut butter is powdered peanut butter, which is half the calories and doubles the protein.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI quit consuming peanuts completely, however, because I noticed I have smelly gas after, and I think I don't tolerate them (the irony).\r\n\r\n# Nuts and Seeds\r\n\r\nYou know what they say, eat vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds for a healthy diet. I agree only with 40% of this recommendation. The only healthy foods on this planet that anyone can agree with are vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGrains, nuts, and seeds are **high in calories and high in antinutrients** (prevent nutrient absorption.)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you like to drink beer and eat nuts and seeds along the side, no wonder you have a big belly. **Nuts and seeds have ~650kcal per 100g**. 100g of nuts and seeds is less than a handful.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to snack something when watching a movie or when socializing, **choose home-made (not microwaved) popcorn or popcorn without added fat**. It has only 350kcal per 100g, but 100g is a lot.\r\n\r\n# Granola and Muesli\r\n\r\nMy journey to eating healthy begun with eating muesli, which is cereal combined with dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. If you also add some milk, you can have 1000kcal in a single meal. Now, if I think about it, granola is not that healthy, as it may contain a lot of sugar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy breakfast on muesli and milk had 1500kcal and didn't keep me so full, as it is mainly carbs and sugar. When we eat a **meal high in carbs and sugar (and fat), with low fiber and protein, we get an insulin spike and then a crash** (like Bitcoin in 2017). After the crash, we are hungry again.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Grains (pasta is from grains), dried fruits, sugar, and honey usually have 350kcal per 100g**. If you add the nuts and seeds, 100g granola (or muesli) can have 450 kcal per 100g, with minimal protein and fiber.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA better option is oatmeal with fruits and low fat cottage cheese or yogurt. Oatmeal, like bread, popcorn, or rice cakes, is expanded cereal, which adds more volume and fewer calories (~35% fewer calories.)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   choose low-fat foods if losing body fat is your goal;\r\n-   use oil and butter carefully, with a spray or teaspoon;\r\n-   avoid nuts and seeds;\r\n-   choose expanded grains (bread, popcorn, oatmeal, rice cakes) instead of ready to eat grains (granola, muesli, cornflakes, .etc.).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

We also need to keep in mind seasons and climate.\r\n\r\nWe are not herbivores, like elephants or giraffes, because we don't have big multi-chamber stomachs. We are also not carnivores (predators), because we don't have huge claws and teeth like tigers. We are something in between - **hunter-gatherers.**\r\n\r\nWe need to eat fresh vegetables and fruits (and some nuts and seeds from the shell) in seasons. The rest of the time, we need to hunt wild animals.\r\n\r\nWe also don't eat to eat all the time, because food may not be available all the time.

Compared to regular tap water, spring water contains lots of minerals, and it is slightly alkaline.\r\n\r\nOf course, springs are not at every step, but we can there is **spring bottled water** in the markets. Just keep your eyes open for scams. Many bottles of water contain tap water.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more guaranteed, you can buy a water filter. The best one is the **reverse osmosis filter**.

Or, on the other side, have you ever heard people sleeping for 12 hours and always be tired?\r\n\r\nThe reason is the sleep quality.  The better the quality, the better the effect of sleep has on our body, like healing and assimilation.\r\n\r\nHow to achieve good quality sleep?

Nowadays, we spend most of our lives in boxes (houses, cars, buses, trains) which makes us deprived of fresh air and sunlight.\r\n\r\n**We need sunlight for vitamin D, which is a precursor for a lot of hormones.** We also need fresh air for oxygen, of course.\r\n\r\nNow, we live on a polluted planet, which is a big pitty, and we can hardly find fresh air. We don't need to be perfect, though, so **spending time in nature is enough.** \r\n\r\nPracticality: **spend some time in nature or outside at least 1 hour every day.**\r\n\r\n# Relationships\r\nIf we look in nature, we see animal groups everywhere. Rarely animals live alone, including humans. **Humans are social beings**. We have evolved living in tribes and communities. We looked after one another, and this is what we should.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, technological evolution and its overuse have disconnected us from each other. Rarely we connect and spend good time with the people who matter. Social media is a major reason why depression and anxiety are on the rise.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch to this.

After I do some work, I prepare my first main meal, usually around 11:00 a.m. The **whey protein shake, creatine, greens powder, vitamin D3, medicinal mushrooms (for immunity) are the only supplements I take.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy first main meal is usually an **omelet** (five eggs and six egg whites), two cans of **grilled mackerel in water**, three slices of **toast bread**, some **tomatoes**, some **red peppers**, some **greek yogurt**, some **fruit**, and some **green tea**. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe second meal is usually around 5:00 p.m., and I will have **some lean meat with vegetables**. It can be grilled **chicken breast**, baked **sweet potatoes**, and some **salad** in some days. On other days, it can be some grilled **beef** with **potatoes** and salad. Sometimes I will make a **stew** with lots of vegetables and lean meat. This meal is around 1000kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter this meal, I will eat some **fruit**, depending on the season. It can be watermelon, peaches, nectarines, blackberries, apples, cherries, clementines, etc. This snack is around 300kcal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI like consistency. **I enjoy eating the same foods**, my favorite foods, over and over again. It requires less mental energy. I never have cheat meals because I don't need them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, there are days and periods I am away from home, or I hang out with my friends, girlfriend, or (and) family. When this happens, I focus on my favorite food groups: vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. If these are not present, I eat small portions of something similar.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI drink alcohol on occasions, but only when I have a day off from everything the next day, usually on Saturday or Friday. When I drink, I choose low-calorie drinks, like wine, cognac, or \"rachiu\" (a beverage from Romania similar to tequila, but better).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI try to avoid, when not at home, fried foods, fatty foods, and deserts. These are high in calories, low in volume, and highly palatable. They make me eat them without stopping.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy strategy is to **eat foods high in volume, rich in water, fiber, and protein, and low in calories**. It is the reason why I eat vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. These foods fill me up with the least amount of calories. They also offer me all the essential nutrients I need: amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI don't keep in my house trigger foods, foods that I like so much that I cannot stop eating them after I begin. For me, these foods are peanut butter and coconut, or foods containing them. I like them so much that I cannot stop myself at a bite.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be as lean as possible. Of course, I want to increase my muscle mass as well, but I don't think I have the genetics to be a monster. To achieve my goal, I stay in a constant calorie deficit or maintenance at a maximum and eat sufficient protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My daily requirements are ~3000kcal, and I eat ~2500kcal.** Some days I burn less and eat less. It depends. I also aim to consume **200g protein per day,** to build and preserve my muscle mass, and 100g fats. I don't care how much carbs I consume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **eat only foods you enjoy and avoid trigger foods, but make sure they are high in volume and low in calories.**\r\n\r\n# Exercise\r\n\r\nI love walking. I **walk everyday 6-15km**. During these sessions, I burn 350-900kcal. It is an exercise I can do regardless of the weather, with any equipment, anywhere, any time. It also helps me relax, makes me feel better, and sleep better.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am also a fan of strength training. **I go to the gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and train all the muscle groups in one session**. For a while, I went to the gym six days per week, using the push-pull-legs split, but it was too exhausting, and I didn't have the Saturday off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe full-body training split ensures I equally train all the muscle groups, and I have a rest day between sessions for my muscles and nervous system to recover. I also have the weekends off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **do the exercises you enjoy and which you can stick to** regardless of external circumstances.\r\n\r\n# Sleep\r\n\r\nSleep is so underrated these days. We cannot make wise decisions and function at our full potential without good quality sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sleep, it is not much to say. I **fall asleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 08:00 a.m.** every day. Sometimes, on weekends, I go to bed later and wake up later, but not every weekend. Whenever I can, I stick to my sleeping schedule, and I aim **towards 8-9 hours of sleep per night.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have some habits before bed, though. **After 10:30 p.m. (1 hour before sleep), all lights are turned off** and avoid them. Artificial lights make me alert and disrupt my melatonin (sleep hormone) levels. Maybe it happens to you too. I also **keep the room dark as a cave and not too warm.**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn my phone and laptop, I use the Iris app to filter out blue light, which hurts my eyes and disrupts my sleep.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI noticed that chamomile tea before bed helps me sleep a lot better, so I drink 2-4 cups before bed. When I don't have tea, I take a sleep supplement with valerian root, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d3, and melatonin. I don't recommend any supplements to anyone; I am just informing what I do.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe take-away is to **go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours** so that the body sets its circadian rhythm. Also, avoid any form of artificial light 1 hour before bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat is all my friends. The big lesson you need to take from this article is to **create a routine for life that you enjoy.**\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   I eat foods high in volume and low in calories (vegetables, fruit, and lean meats), that I enjoy, and avoid foods that I can't stop eating;\r\n-   I walk every day and train my entire body three times per week;\r\n-   I go to bed and wake up every day at the same hours, and avoid artificial light one hour before bed;\r\n-   one day per week, I don't stick to my routines and enjoy life with my loved ones.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

What you need is correct exercise execution and constant progress, a nutritious and balanced diet, and good quality sleep. That's it!\r\n\r\nAfter you've maintained a routine for at least a year, then you can start investing in supplements.\r\n\r\nWhat most fitness addicts recommend is:\r\n\r\n-   whey isolate protein (or pea + hemp protein mix if you're a vegan);\r\n-   l-glutamine;\r\n-   creatine monohydrate;\r\n-   l-carnitine;\r\n-   organic vitamins and minerals complex;\r\n-   krill oil;\r\n-   for lazy days, a pre-workout (citrulline malate, beta-alanine, caffeine).\r\n\r\nAny other supplement is not worth the hype.\r\n\r\n# Patience\r\n\r\nLower your expectations.

Stay with me as our posts are always short and concise.\r\n\r\nThere are many magic pills spread around the web that guarantee easy and rapid fat loss. I am sorry for disappointing you, but if you are looking for the easy and fast solution, you are going to crash and burn.\r\n\r\n**Fat loss is all about human physiology.** If you understand the basics (like everything in life) you will no longer waste your time, money, and energy on useless crap.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the human body is an amazingly complex machine that is influenced by the environment, so it's impossible to track everything; we can't be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut let's focus on what we can control, okay?\r\n\r\n2 major factors impact fat loss:\r\n\r\n# Energy deficit\r\n\r\nOf course, I am talking about calories. This is the golden rule, you cannot eat anything as much as you can without getting fat, regardless of how healthy it is.\r\n\r\n# Hormones\r\n\r\nHormones are, basically, chemical messengers that help our cells communicate with each other. Hormones dictate our state, how we feel, okay? This includes hunger.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule for permanent and smart fat loss is a combination of the two factors above:\r\n\r\n**Maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.**\r\n\r\nMake sure you remember this: maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry and tapping into the fat stores for energy.\r\n\r\nThis is where all diets fail. They either do not maintain a proper energy deficit, either are making you hungrier day by day, either they don't help you tap into the fat stores for energy, but your muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most effective fat loss diet, in my opinion, is the Paleo diet. Why? It is most easier to maintain, it's balanced, and it helps you achieve energy deficit without even thinking about it. You feel full all the time.\r\n\r\nThe secret? **Include whole foods found in nature**. Whole foods are high in protein, fiber, water, (healthy) fats, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, etc and are minimally processed.\r\n\r\nThese foods nourish your body to the cellular level with minimum energy. As a result, you will feel full, satisfied, energized, and in an energy deficit.\r\n\r\nI will recommend you use at the beginning a food tracker like **MyFitnessPal** to have an estimate of your daily nutrient and energy intake.\r\n\r\nFor fat loss, you should set **a 10% energy deficit.**\r\n\r\nLet's not forget about 2 important combos to fat loss: **movement and sleep**.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about exercise like running, boxing, or strength training, but movement. Move your body as much as possible. Exercise is not for fat loss, remember that.\r\n\r\nMovement is - besides other health benefits - for fat loss. Why? You burn more energy through day to day movement than exercise. Take the stairs, go to work or school by foot or bicycle, stand on your desk, etc.\r\n\r\n**Avoid sitting as much as possible and be active throughout the day.**\r\n\r\nSleep is our primary hormone regulator - melatonin. Without good quality sleep, our body won't be able to heal itself and burn energy from fat.\r\n\r\nAlso, **sleep deprivation makes you hungrier** and makes you crave sugary or/and fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe ideal sleeping time is from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m., but we cannot all follow that schedule. Thus, I suggest going to bed and waking up every day at the same time and make sure you sleep 7-9 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can also try some of these [sleeping hacks](https://www.lifestylemaniacs.com/sleeping-hacks).\r\n\r\nNow we know how to maintain a proper energy deficit without feeling hungry. But what about tapping into fat stores?\r\n\r\nTo tap into our fat store we need to manage one hormone: **insulin**.\r\n\r\nInsulin is the anabolic hormone that opens the gates to our cells to receive energy and nutrients. This includes fat cells.\r\n\r\nRemember this rule: **it's impossible to burn fat when insulin is in the blood.**\r\n\r\nThe question is now: when is insulin in the blood?\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted mostly after consuming carbohydrates, especially those without fiber (processed) and protein; **fats don't give any insulin response**.\r\n\r\nThere has also been debunked that **insulin is secreted even when chewing. smelling, or seeing food, not just ingesting.**\r\n\r\nThis is why diets low in carbohydrates (e.g. Keto) and intermittent fasting are so effective for fat loss. I prefer intermittent fasting as it is easier to maintain and it also offers many health benefits.\r\n\r\nIntermittent fasting is going for 16-24 hours (on average) with only water. This ensures all the insulin becomes absent in the bloodstream and our body relies heavily on stored fat for energy.\r\n\r\nYou can also try doing cardio or any form of exercise on an empty stomach early in the morning when insulin is absent to be sure that all the energy is burned from your fat stores.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is what you should get from this article:\r\n - Always choose **whole foods** instead of processed foods;\r\n - Track your foods to achieve a **10% caloric deficit**;\r\n - **Stay active** throughout the day;\r\n - Have a **regular sleep schedule**, ideally from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 - 8:00 a.m.;\r\n - Go **low carb** or try **intermittent fasting**.\r\n\r\n # Follow the white rabbit\r\n - [Do Calories Matter?

Just read the label, and you'll see.\r\n\r\nSugars and sweeteners are also in the kitchen of every living soul.\r\n\r\nRemember this, **if it is sweet or contains something ending in \"-ose\", it is/has sugars**, regardless of being natural or artificial.\r\n\r\nSince the 19th century, we have been consuming sweeteners like water. We are drinking sugar with all the juices out there; it is the reason for **metabolic diseases**.\r\n\r\n**_Sugar is addictive and has the same effects on our body as alcohol, but without the hangover._**\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with artificial sweeteners is they cause **blood sugar and insulin spike**, which will turn into fat. Even artificial sweeteners, although with no glycemic response, cause insulin spikes and resistance.\r\n\r\nThey are also **highly inflammator**y and **impair nutrient absorption**  **(malnutrition)**.\r\n\r\n## Health problems\r\n- **Heart disease;**\r\n- **Cardiovascular disease;**\r\n- **Type 2 diabetes;**\r\n- **Fat/Weight gain (Obesity);**\r\n- **Metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes;**\r\n- **Dysbiosis (e.g., IBS, IBD);**\r\n- **Aging;**\r\n- **Skin problems;**\r\n- **Bone and joint problems (Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis);**\r\n- **Brain problems (e.g., Depression, Memory/Alzheimer's, Anxiety, ADD/ADHD);**\r\n- **Fatty liver disease;**\r\n- **Weak immune system;**\r\n- **Cravings;**\r\n- **Addiction.**\r\n\r\n## Secret sugar names and sources\r\n- **Agave Nectar;**\r\n- **Barbados Sugar;**\r\n- **Barley Malt Syrup;**\r\n- **Beet Sugar;**\r\n- **Blackstrap Molasses;**\r\n- **Cane Crystals;**\r\n- **Cane Juice Crystals;**\r\n- **Castor Sugar;**\r\n- **Coconut Sugar;**\r\n- **Corn Sweetener;**\r\n- **Corn Syrup;**\r\n- **Corn Syrup Solids;**\r\n- **Crystalline Fructose;**\r\n- **Date Sugar;**\r\n- **Demerara Sugar;**\r\n- **Dextrose;**\r\n- **Evaporated Cane Juice;**\r\n- **Florida Crystals;**\r\n- **Fructose;**\r\n- **Fruit Juice;**\r\n- **Fruit Juice Concentrate;**\r\n- **Galactose;**\r\n- **Glucose;**\r\n- **Glucose Solids;**\r\n- **Golden Sugar;**\r\n- **Golden Syrup;**\r\n- **Granulated Sugar;**\r\n- **Grape Juice Concentrate;**\r\n- **Grape Sugar;**\r\n- **High-Fructose Corn Syrup;**\r\n- **Honey;**\r\n- **Icing Sugar;**\r\n- **Invert Sugar;**\r\n- **Lactose;**\r\n- **Malt Syrup;**\r\n- **Maltodextrin;**\r\n- **Maltose;**\r\n- **Mannitol;**\r\n- **Maple Syrup;**\r\n- **Molasses;**\r\n- **Muscovado Syrup;**\r\n- **Organic Raw Sugar;**\r\n- **Powdered Sugar;**\r\n- **Raw Sugar;**\r\n- **Refiners' Syrup;**\r\n- **Rice Syrup;**\r\n- **Sorbitol;**\r\n- **Sorghum Syrup;**\r\n- **Sucrose;**\r\n- **Table Sugar;**\r\n- **Treacle;**\r\n- **Turbinado Sugar;**\r\n- **Yellow Sugar.**\r\n\r\n## Artificial sweeteners names\r\n- **Acesulfame K;**\r\n- **Aspartame;**\r\n- **Erythritol;**\r\n- **Saccharin;**\r\n- **Sorbitol;**\r\n- **Sucralose;**\r\n- **Stevia;**\r\n- **Xylitol.**\r\n\r\n## What are the substitutes?\r\nThe best substitute for a sweet tooth is undoubtedly **fresh fruit**.\r\n\r\nBut let's get real, we cannot deprive ourselves completely from sugars. The important thing is to identify the sources with high amounts and eliminate them. Probably the **worst sugar and sweetener sources are beverages**, and those should be substituted with water.\r\n\r\nIf you are sedentary and have metabolic issues, you should quit sugar and sweetener consumption altogether. Otherwise, a tablespoon of **raw honey** a day should be enough; honey is also extremely honey in small daily amounts. The safest sweetener out there is **stevia**, which is safe in small amounts (one teaspoon per day).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, **start small**. Eliminate sugar in baby steps not entirely from the beginning.\r\n\r\n# Plant seed oils\r\nThe cases of hypertension, heart disease, cardiovascular disease, strokes, etc. have increased drastically since the substitution of animal fat with plant seed oils and margarine.\r\n\r\nThe real reason why plant seed oils are dangerous is that they contain high amounts of **polyunsaturated fats**. These kind of fats are **extremely unstable** and become rancid almost immediately after packaging.\r\n\r\nMost plant seed oils are **partially hydrogenated** to extend shelf life, which makes them more harmful as they now contain **trans fat**.

Otherwise, a tablespoon of <strong>raw honey</strong> a day should be enough; honey is also extremely honey in small daily amounts.

Muscle building is all about science.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Anatomy and Physiology\r\n**Muscle fibers** compose the muscle and **myofibrils** compose a muscle fiber. The nervous system innervates muscle fibers via **motor neurons**.\r\nOnly one motor neuron can innervate one or more muscle fibers of the same type. A motor neuron and its fibers are called a **motor unit.**\r\n\r\nThere are three types of muscle fibers:\r\n- **Type I: slow-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIA: fast-twitch/oxidative;**\r\n- **Type IIB: fast-glycolytic.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nType II are best suited to generating large amounts of force over a short period and are very sensitive to fatigue.\r\nType I fibers are best suited to low-load, long-duration activities.\r\n\r\nThe size of the muscle determines the size of the muscle, not their number (genetically determined).\r\n\r\nThe primary energy currency for all cells is **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**.\r\n\r\nThe **mitochondria** are responsible for producing ATP via:\r\n- **Phosphagen system** (anaerobic) - the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC);\r\n- **Anaerobic glycolysis** (anaerobic);\r\n- **Oxidative phosphorylation** (aerobic) - Kreb's cycle and electron transport chain.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nATP replenishment times:\r\n- 20 sec - 50.00 %;\r\n- 40 sec - 75.00 %;\r\n- 1 min - 87.50 %;\r\n- 80 sec - 93.75 %;\r\n- 100 sec - 96.88 %;\r\n- 2 mins - 98.44 %;\r\n- 140 sec - 99.22 %;\r\n- 160 sec - 99.61 %;\r\n- 3 min - 99.81 %.\r\n\r\n# Muscle Growth (Hypertrophy)\r\nThere are two types of hypertrophy:\r\n- **Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy**;\r\n- **Sarcomere hypertrophy**.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy means more tissue involved in energy supply and neural drive.

Carbohydrates and dietary fats ratios depend on each individual; meal frequency as well.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of muscle building should be (organic) **whole foods** and not fitness supplements.\r\nProbably, the only supplements I recommend are:\r\n- Good quality **Complete protein powder** (e.g., whey, pea, hemp);\r\n- **Creatine monohydrate** or complex;\r\n- **Multi-vitamins and multi-mineral complex** (extracted from natural food sources);\r\n- **Krill Oil** (Omega-3s).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nOther supplements may be marketing bullshit and a waste of money.\r\n\r\n# Other lifestyle factors\r\nOf course, the building process happens outside the gym, especially at night. **Sleep** is one of the most important factors for muscle recovery and, hence, development.\r\n\r\nSleep quantity is not as important as sleep quality. If you can catch the sleep between **10:00 p.m. and 02:00 a.m.**, it is perfect. Otherwise, be sure to **go to sleep and wake up at the same hours** every day, including on weekends. It all has to do with melatonin production, but that is a story for another article.\r\n\r\nMake sure to **stay hydrated**. We need **2-6L of water per day**, depending on weight, climate, activity levels, and stress levels.\r\n\r\n**Chronic stress** is also a significant factor for muscle catabolism (loss). Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to keep your heart rate low and constant.

We are with no doubt at war from all points of view.\r\n\r\n-   the economy is about to crash;\r\n-   people die and are sick all around the planet;\r\n-   we need to stay at home without seeing our close ones;\r\n-   some of us are unemployed;\r\n-   some of us work critical hours to help humanity (e.g., medical doctors, nurses, firefighters, military, police).\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus threatens not only our health but also our finances and psyche. **We face a new depression, probably the new great depression of the 21st century.**\r\n\r\nThese are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. These challenges are useless if we don't learn anything from them. We as humanity need to make a change. Let's take a look at some lessons I learned from this, and maybe so did you.\r\n\r\n# 1. Health is the most critical asset\r\n\r\nI learned this lesson 7 years ago, but repetition is the mother of skills. We need to take care of our health in a proactive fashion. Not cure, but prevent. We need to invest in our health like in our child.\r\n\r\nIt is selfish to not take care of you before others. You know why? Because if you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the energy and strength, both physical and mental, to take care of others. That is how you need to think.\r\n\r\nTake care of yourself so that you live to take care of others. **You are useless on this planet if you're dead or sick.**\r\n\r\nWe are also in a position where no amount of money can buy health, simply because we have no cure. **Our only treatment and shield against this virus (and any pathogen) is our immune system**. And it pisses me off that we are not informed about how to strengthen our immunity. \r\n\r\nAll I see and hear is stay at home, keep the distance, sanitize, wear masks, and gloves. I agree with hand washing and keeping them away from your face. However, **staying at home is counterintuitive**.\r\n\r\nOur immune system needs vitamin D. Stay closed at home, no sunlight, no vitamin D, no serotonin (happiness), no immunity. Gather around the other factors of unhappiness and stress (no money, no job, loneliness), and our immune system is compromised.\r\n\r\nYou see, the advice that should protect us does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIf I were a leader or influencer, I would have suggested:\r\n\r\n-   avoid closed and public areas;\r\n-   wear masks and gloves when physically contacting new people;\r\n-   wash your hands, wallet, phone, and keys, when coming home;\r\n-   wash your hands before touching your face or eating;\r\n-   save your money (don't buy what you don't need);\r\n-   limit alcohol and smoking;\r\n-   eat real food and limit processed food;\r\n-   drink plenty of water;\r\n-   get 6-10 hours of regular sleep (depending on age);\r\n-   exercise daily, especially outdoors in nature;\r\n-   take some immunity supplements (e.g., vitamin d3, zinc, ashwagandha, ginger, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are real pieces of advice we all need to incorporate for life, even after we'll have eradicated the virus.\r\n\r\n# 2. Money is useless if you can't use it\r\n\r\nThere was a rumor that there will no longer be food in the market or that all food markets will be closed. Also, all restaurants, bars, clothing shops, everything except online and food markets are closed. Not only that, what is the point of buying expensive clothing when you no one sees you? Frankly, no one even gives a shit about looks in these dark times.\r\n\r\n**What is the point of having more money than you need in these times if all you can buy - and should buy - are strict daily requirements?**\r\n\r\nMy advice to everybody, including myself, is to save your money, and, if you have too much, donate to people in need. Trust me; some people really need the money more than you do.\r\n\r\n# 3. Be prepared for anything\r\n\r\nI am lucky in this sense. My life made me crave independence, and I continue to live independently as much as possible.\r\n\r\n-   I invested in a minimal home gym;\r\n-   I take cold showers;\r\n-   I spend most time alone;\r\n-   I work remotely;\r\n-   I cook and prepare my food;\r\n-   I live a healthy lifestyle;\r\n-   I don't depend on my parents.\r\n\r\nI am lucky, and I have created my luck for seven years now, and it seems all the sacrifices paid out.\r\n\r\nLife is unpredictable and makes sure our plans don't apply. **We, as humans, need to be able to adapt to whatever life brings us.** It is the species with the most significant power to change that will survive and hopefully thrive.\r\n\r\n# 4. Loneliness is a slow killer\r\n\r\nLoneliness is a more significant cause of heart disease than alcohol and smoking. We can learn to live alone, but we will never thrive on this lifestyle, only survive. We are social beings, and we need to love and be loved.\r\n\r\nWe need to share, laugh, talk, and feel the energy of people around us.\r\n\r\nYou may say we have social media and messaging apps to chit-chat, but this is not and never be a solution. I feel more depressed after spending time on social media than not spending time on it at all. A virtual connection is not nearly as powerful as a physical connection.\r\n\r\n**Let us focus more on seeing people in real life and living outside of this virtual reality**. We need to learn to be human again and step away from the hypocrisy social media has to bring. **What we see on social media is a perfect, fairy-tale, unicorn life, and we know it.**\r\n\r\nLife will never be perfect. Life is, most of the time, a routine, monotonous, and we need to accept that. We become successful through consistency, which is a routine. I agree that we need a break from time to time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\n**We need to take breaks when our life and goals are at peace**, that is how I become who I am, through sacrifice and monotony, and I am proud of who I am, respected or not.\r\n\r\nNow, I also sometimes put pictures on social media and maybe regret afterwards, but this is because my subconscious thinks I should do so. After all, everyone does so. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, **we often share to receive attention through comments and likes. We get temporary satisfaction, but it is not the real deal.** The likes and comments are for what we shared, not for who shared.\r\n\r\n**Social media friends and followers are not and never will be real friends.**\r\n\r\n# 5. Not everything we read or hear is true\r\n\r\nEverybody is an expert and has an opinion these days. It is funny that those with the lowest expertise are the ones with the most significant criticism and shout out. There are also influencers and, just because they are well known, they're opinion matters.\r\n\r\n**We need to learn to ask questions and think before believing and applying others' pieces of advice.**\r\n\r\nJust ask, \"why?\". Does it make any sense? Learn to do your research and get familiar with all scientific areas to avoid being fooled.\r\n\r\n**The cause of the corona-panic was the misinformation spread and believed on social media**. Also, the numbers of deaths and infected cases are both overrated and underrated from one country to another.\r\n\r\nReporters make everything so dramatic and resentence phrases just to be catchy. Their priority is to spread the news and to make people read it, regardless of the story.\r\n\r\n**Think outside the box, stay curious, and ask questions.**\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*There you have it!

It seemed to be an intriguing question for most men, and maybe even unanswered.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere was a time I stopped trying to understand women, saying they are impossible to understand. It is like a stereotype that we, as men, don't know what women want.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with them more and more and reading some self-development and psychological books, I concluded that women have some logic in their behavior.\r\n\r\n# Primal impulses\r\n\r\nWe are the most evolved form of life on the planet because of our brain. However, we still have our urges and impulses caused by our primal brain.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe brain is like an onion: it has layers of grey matter. Our brain doesn't grow per se, but it adds new layers of knowledge, if you may. Thus, our first animal brain is still there beneath our fancy evolved brain. His job is survival: eat, drink, run (or fight), and reproduce.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with women?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nVery simple. Women are **hard-wired to look for security**. When it comes to men, women want real men. Real men are self-confident, know what they want in life, have self-control, ae strong emotionally, mentally, and physically, have goals, and know who they are. In other words, real men bring all forms of security to women: emotional, mental, financial, and physical.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNowadays, we no longer live in the woods. Women no longer need physical protection from men as they did before. If you're a guy, you don't need to be 2 meters tall and have huge muscles and strength to be attractive to women. You also don't need to be rich to be attractive to women.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat **women chase today in men is confidence and self-control**. The biggest strengths today are emotional and mental strength. It is why they usually run with the bad boy. Bad boys are self-confident and make themselves their biggest priority. In contrast, good guys are needy, suffocate women, and make them what they are not - gods of love.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWomen are very good at making sure their man is strong within and are trying to make him stronger. They achieve this by testing him by putting him under emotional and mental pressure. If he always fails and acts like a little girl or makes a big deal out of her tests, then he is not a real man, and she will leave him in the end.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does a test look? Well, let's say, for instance, that you probably gained a few pounds and you have a belly. Your women will make fun of you that you are fat like a pig. She will tell you to move your but and do some exercise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you react like a girl and say: \"Stop making fun of me, I don't like it. You are making me feel bad,\" then this is not how a man reacts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you can say is: \"Yeah! I am like a pig. Be a good girl and scratch my belly from time to time, won't you?\" and laugh about it. You can also say: \"I don't know. I kind of look sexy with this belly.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGot the idea? The idea is: **don't take her seriously**. Always be prepared to make a laugh of her complaints towards you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBe careful, though. There are times when you must take her seriously. If she tells you not to stop leaving your underwear on the floor, then you have to listen to her. In this case, you can make fun of yourself by smiling and saying: \"Oh man. My bad. I forgot to tell you that we have a pig in the house. I will go and put him back in his cage.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, you make fun of your mistakes, but still, you will keep in mind to improve. You also made each other laugh about the issue.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe point is, **don't be intimidated by her and don't make her your queen**. She is your woman, and you are her man.\r\n\r\n# Emotions\r\n\r\nWe men are rational beings. We always try to find patterns and some sense in everything. Women, however, are emotional beings. They behave and act based on their current emotional state (mood).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring periods of pressure, blood flows differently in the brains of men and women. **In women, blood flows more in the limbic system,** the emotional brain**, whereas in men, blood flows more in the prefrontal cortex,** the part of the brain involved in decision making and problem-solving. [[1]](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071119170133.htm)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt makes sense now why **during stress, women make no sense**. The part of the brain involved in emotions overrides the part of the brain involved in rationality. Women are overwhelmed by their feelings, and that is why we, as men, need to be emotionally stable. We need to be there for them and support them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext time she complaints about something or over-reacts, understand that it is not her fault. If her mood is changing, realize that it is her natural dynamic. Don't take it personally as if it is your fault. Be a man for your woman, because that is what she wants.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n-   women are hard-wired to seek financial, emotional, mental, and physical security, so, they will look for these features in a man;\r\n-   women want their men to be strong mentally, emotionally, and physically, so, they will test them and try to make them stronger;\r\n-   women are emotional beings (limbic system-oriented), whereas men are rational beings (prefrontal cortex-oriented).
